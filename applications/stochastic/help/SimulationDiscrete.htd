<h1>Discrete Stochastic Simulations</h1>

<p>
We consider discrete stochastic simulations that are modelled with a set
of species and a set of reactions that transform the species' amounts.
Instead of using a
continuum approximation and dealing with species mass or concentration, 
the amount of each species is a non-negative integer which is the population.
Depending on the species, this could be the number of molecules or the
number of organisms, etc. Reactions transform a set reactants into a set of
products, each being a linear combination of species with integer coefficients.

<p>
Consider a system of <em>N</em> species represented by the state vector 
<em>X(t) = (X<sub>1</sub>(t), ... X<sub>N</sub>(t))</em>.
<em>X<sub>n</sub>(t)</em> is the population of the 
<em>n<sup>th</sup></em> species at time <em>t</em>.
There are <em>M</em> reaction channels
which change the state of the system.  Each reaction is characterized by 
a propensity function <em>a<sub>m</sub></em> and a state change vector
<em>V<sub>m</sub> = (V<sub>m1</sub>, ..., V<sub>mN</sub>)</em>.
<em>a<sub>m</sub> dt</em> is the 
probability that the <em>m<sup>th</sup></em> reaction will occur in the 
infinitesimal time interval <em>[t .. t + dt)</em>.  The state 
change vector is the difference between the state after the reaction and 
before the reaction.
</p>

<p>
To generate a trajectory (a possible realization of the evolution of the
system) one starts with an initial state and then repeatedly fires reactions.
To fire a reaction, one must answer the two questions:
<ol>
  <li> When will the next reaction fire?
  <li> Which reaction will fire next?
</ol>
Let the next reaction have index &mu; and fire at time <em>t + &tau;</em>.
Let &alpha; be the sum of the propensities.  The time to the
next reaction is an exponentially distributed random variable with mean
1 / &alpha; ; the probability density function is 
<em>P(&tau; = x) = &alpha; e<sup>- &alpha; x</sup></em>.
The index of the next reaction to fire is a discrete random variable
with probability mass function <em>P(&mu; = m) = a<sub>m</sub> / &alpha;</em>.
