In the recorder panel you specify the species and/or reactions that you
want to record in the simulation output. Press
<img src="add.png">&nbsp; or 
<img src="list-remove.png">&nbsp; to select or deselect all of
the species or reactions.  If you modify a model the recordable items
will be updated automatically.  The items that may be recorded depend
on the type of simulation. When generating uniformly-spaced time
series data you may select any combination of species and reactions.
For trajectories that record all reaction events, all of the species
and reactions are marked as being recorded.  When using histograms to
record stochastic trajectories, you may select any combination of
species.
