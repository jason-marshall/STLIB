<h1>First Reaction Method</h1>

<p>
Gillespie's first reaction method generates a uniform random deviate for
each reaction at each time step.  These uniform deviates are used to compute
exponential deviates which are the times at which each reaction will next fire.
By selecting the minimum of these times, one identifies the time and 
the index of the first reaction to fire.  The algorithm for a single step
is given below.
<ol>
<li> for <em>m</em> in <em>[1..M]</em>:
  <ol>
    <li> Compute a<sub>m</sub> from <em>X</em>.
    <li> Generate a unit, uniform random number <em>r</em>.
    <li> <em>&tau;<sub>m</sub> = -</em>ln<em>(r) / a<sub>m</sub></em>
  </ol>
<li> <em>&tau; = </em>min<em><sub>m</sub> &tau;<sub>m</sub></em>
<li> <em>&mu; =</em> index of the minimum <em>&tau;<sub>m</sub></em>
<li> <em>t = t + &tau;</em>
<li> <em>X = X + V<sub>&mu;</sub></em>
</ol>

As with the direct method, using an efficient exponential deviate generator
will improve the performance. But with the first reaction method an
exponential deviate is generated for each reaction, so using a good generator
is critical. One can also improve the efficiency by only
computing those propensities that have changed. For this one needs a reaction
influence data structure. The implementation of the first reaction method in
Cain uses these optimizations.

The first reaction method is not as efficient as the direct method. Taking a
step has linear complexity in the number of reactions and it requires
more random numbers than the direct method. For small problems it has
acceptable performance, but it is not efficient for large problems.
The first reaction method may be adapted
to re-use the reaction times instead of regenerating them at each step.
This method is introduced next.
