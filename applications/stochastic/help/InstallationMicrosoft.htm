<h1>Installation on Microsoft Windows</h1>

<p>
For Microsoft Windows, Cain is distributed as an executable.
Download and run the installer. The example data files are in the
<tt>examples</tt> folder in the application directory. They are also
distributed separately in the zip file <tt>CainExamplesWindows-x.y.zip</tt>.
The mass-action solvers are
pre-compiled. In order to use custom propensities you will need a compiler;
Cain uses Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. If you do not already have MSVS 2010,
get
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Express/Downloads/">Microsoft Visual C++
2010 Express Edition</a>. It is a free, command line version of Visual Studio.
Select the Visual C++ 2010 Express download.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Currently the GNU compiler is supported. (I am working on support for
Microsoft Visual Studio.) You can obtain the GNU compiler from the
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> project. Install the C++
compiler and add the installation directory to your path. That is
append the installation directory to the <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable.

To uninstall Cain, select <tt>Cain&rarr;Uninstall Cain</tt> from the
start menu.

I got an unusual error when I made the Cain 1.4 Windows installer -->
using the Enthought Python distribution: The application only worked
if Python was installed. I rebuilt the installer using the Python
distribution from python.org. This rectified the problem.
