<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://www.helpblocks.com/">HelpBlocks</a> is used to build
wxWidgets HTML help files. The sources are in the <tt>help</tt>
directory and have the extension <tt>htd</tt>. One can edit the sources
with the HelpBlocks application or with any text editor. One needs the
HelpBlocks program to build zipped wxWidgets help files that are
stored <tt>cain.htb</tt>.
</p>

<p>
There is no automatic way to convert the archive of HTML files into a
PDF document. Thus I have written an index of the files in
<tt>index.html</tt>. If you add a new section to the
documentation you will need to update this file.
I use Adobe Acrobat Pro to convert this HTML file to the PDF
version of the documentation. When creating the PDF document click the
&quot;Capture Multiple Levels&quot; button and select
&quot;Entire site&quot;.
