<h1>Command Line Solvers</h1>

<p>
Cain uses command line executables to carry out the simulations. The
executables are in the <tt>solvers</tt> directory.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to add a new simulation method to Cain if it is similar to
one of the built-in methods. Just write a
program that reads the same input format and generates the same output
format as one of the other solvers. You can write your program in any
language and use any software or hardware resources that you have on
your machine.  Although it is not required, it is a good idea to make
your program serial.  Cain utilizes concurrency by running multiple
instances of a solver.  Place your program in the <tt>solvers</tt>
directory. Then edit the data in the file
<tt>state/simulationMethods.py</tt>.
