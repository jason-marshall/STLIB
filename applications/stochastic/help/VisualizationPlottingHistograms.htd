<h1>Plotting Histograms</h1>

<p>
Open the file <tt>examples/cain/CaoPetzold2006_Schlogl.xml</tt> and
select the &quot;Schlogl&quot; model and the &quot;Time Series&quot;
method. Select all of the species and reactions in the recorder panel
and then generate 10 trajectories. The steady state distribution of
species populations is bi-modal. In the plot of the trajectories below
we can see that the trajectory paths separate into two groups.

We will study how the trajectories separate into a bi-modal
distribution.  Select the &quot;Histograms Transient&quot; method,
which records the populations in histograms at 6 frames. Generate
10,000 trajectories and then
click the plotting button <img src="plot.png">&nbsp;
in the simulation output panel to bring up the plot
configuration window. In this window select the &quot;Histograms&quot;
tab. At the top of the window see that the &quot;Schlogl, Histograms
Transient&quot; output is selected. Next choose the
&quot;Multi-frame&quot; option. (There is only a single species so you
don't need to select the species to plot.) The plot configuration
window is shown below.

Click the &quot;Plot together&quot; button to generate the plot shown below.

Note that the plot range is set to include the tall, thin histogram that shows
the initial condition at <i>t = 0</i>. With this plot range we
cannot distinguish the features of the other histograms. We can take a
closer look at them by clicking the zoom button in the plotting window
and selecting a rectangular area. Below is a closer look at the rest
of the histograms.

We can exclude the histogram for the initial value by deselecting the
&quot;Show&quot; field for the <i>t = 0</i> row in the frame table of
the plot configuration window. Next left click the &quot;Line Color&quot;
column header to assign new hues to the remaining selected
frames. Then left click the &quot;Filled&quot; and the &quot;Fill
Color&quot; column headers to turn on filling and match the fill color
to the line color. Right click the &quot;Alpha&quot; header until all
of these values are reduced to 0.2. This will give us a faint fill
color and allow us to see all of the lines. Finally, fill in the title
and axes labels. The resulting plot configuration window is shown below.

Click the &quot;Plot together&quot; button to generate the figure
shown below. We see that at <i>t = 2</i> the trajectories have not yet
separated into two groups. We can see the distribution become bi-modal
as time advances. It appears the distribution is rapidly converging to the
steady state, however this is not the case. In the subsequent sections
we will see that determining the steady state solution requires some care.

Since the Schlogl problem is tricky, we will consider a simpler
problem for introducing visualization of a steady state solution.
Open the file <tt>examples/cain/ImmigrationDeath.xml</tt>. This
problem is examined in the
<a href="ExamplesImmigrationDeath.htm">Immigration Death</a> section
of the <a href="Examples.htm">Examples</a> chapter.
To determine the steady state distribution we will record the state in a time
averaged histogram. First select &quot;ImmigrationDeath10&quot;
from the model list, for which the initial population has been set to 10.
Then select &quot;SteadyState&quot; from the list of methods.
From the simulation parameters in the method editor you can see that
the system is allowed to equilibrate for 100 seconds and then the
state is recorded for 10,000 seconds. Generate 4 trajectories and then
go to the plot configuration window. Clear the title and axes label
from the previous example if necessary. The
&quot;Histograms&quot; tab in this window is shown below.

<p>
Note that since this is an average value histogram, the
&quot;Multi-frame&quot; option is disabled. The
&quot;Multi-species&quot; option is selected, but there is no need to
select a frame. Click the &quot;Plot together&quot; button to generate
the figure shown below.

Let's customize the plot a bit. In the plot configuration window set
the line color to black by right-clicking the column header. Increase
the line width to 2 by left-clicking that column header. Specify that
the region under the line should be filled, set the fill color to green
by clicking on the color cell and set the alpha value to 0.5. Turn off
the legend (there is a single species). Fill in the plot title and
axes labels. Set the title color to blue and the axes label colors to
red. The resulting plot configuration window and plot are shown below.
