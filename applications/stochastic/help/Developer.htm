<h1>Developer's Guide</h1>

<p>
Cain is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and uses the
<a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> GUI toolkit.
For plotting simulation results, it uses
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a> and
<a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">numpy</a>. Cain utilizes command line
executables to perform the simulations. These executables read a description
of the problem (model, method, and number of trajectories)
from stdin and write the trajectories to stdout. Cain launches the
executables; it sends the input and captures the output with pipes. When
launching a job, the user select the number of processes to use. Cain launches
this number of executables. It asks the pool of solvers to each generate
trajectories one at a time until the desired number has been collected.
This allows the user to stop or abort a running simulation and store
the trajectories that have been generated so far.

<!--CONTINUE-->
The source code for Cain, both Python application code and C++ solver
code is available in
<a href="http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/~sean/projects/stlib/stlib.html">STLib</a>.
The Cain application is in <tt>stlib/applications/stochastic</tt>.
The Python source code is split into the three top-level directories:
<tt>gui</tt>, <tt>io</tt>, and <tt>state</tt>. The script <tt>Cain.py</tt>
launches the application. Thus you can launch Cain with the shell command
<tt>python Cain.py</tt>. The solvers are in the <tt>solvers</tt> directory.
There is a makefile there. The executables use STLib's stochastic and
numerical packages, located in <tt>stlib/src</tt>. Consult
STLib's documentation for information about the stochastic simulation
methods, random number generators, etc.

<p>
<b>Mac OS X Distribution.</b><br>
For Mac OS X, Cain is distributed as an application bundle. The Python source
code and the command line executables are placed in a folder called
<tt>Cain.app</tt>. From the Finder, this appears as an application called
Cain. You can make the application bundle by executing
<tt>make bundle</tt> in <tt>stlib/applications/stochastic</tt>.
This copies the appropriate content
into the <tt>Cain.app/Contents/Resources</tt> directory.
I pack the application bundle and example data files (in
<tt>stlib/data/stochastic</tt>) into a disk image for easy distribution.
</p>

<p>
To make a disk image, use Disk Utility. Click New Image and make a 40
MB image called Cain. Quit Disk Utility. In the mounted devices,
changed the name to Cain.  Drag the application bundle to the disk
image. Rename the data folder &quot;stochastic&quot; to &quot;CainExamples&quot;.
Remove the folder &quot;CainExamples/sbml/bmd-2007-9-25&quot;. Drag the
data folder to the disk image.  Finally eject the disk image.
</p>

<p>
<b>Microsoft Windows Distribution.</b><br>
For MS Windows, Cain is distributed as a frozen executable.
I use <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/">py2exe</a> to accomplish this. (See
that web site for details on how the Python interpreter and the Python source
are packed into a stand-alone executable.)
Execute <tt>make win</tt> in <tt>stlib/applications/stochastic</tt>
to build the Cain executable in the <tt>dist</tt> directory.
I use <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/">Inno Setup</a> to make an
installer.
</p>

<p>
<b>Microsoft Windows Development Environment.</b><br>
First get <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started">MinGW</a> 
by running the MinGW-5.1.6 installer.  Then get 
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS">MSYS</a>. Install MSYS 1.0.11,
MSYS DTK 1.0.11, and set the environment variable HOME to
c:msys1.0homeuser_name.  Make a .ssh directory in your home
directory and place your public and private SSH keys there. Then you
can use the shell commands &quot;ssh-agent $SHELL&quot; followed by
&quot;ssh-add&quot; to start a shell with SSH authentication.  Next
install subversion by running the Setup-Subversion-1.6.6.msi
installer, which will add the svn executable to your path. If you
don't already have a text editor, you can download 
<a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">Notepad++</a>.
</p>

<p>
Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Express-2010/">Visual Studio 2010
Express</a>.
</p>

<p>
Install the <a href="http://www.enthought.com/">Enthought Python 
Distribution</a> and then the 
<a href="http://www.py2exe.org/">py2exe</a> package.
</p>

<p>
Install <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php">Inno Setup</a> and 
<a href="http://www.istool.org/">ISTool</a>. Install the 
<a href="http://www.enthought.com/">Enthought Python Distribution</a>.
