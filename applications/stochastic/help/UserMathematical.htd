<h1>Mathematical Expressions</h1>

<p>
Each of the species initial amounts, the propensity factors for mass-action
kinetic laws, and the parameter values are interpreted as Python expressions.
Python supports the standard
<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/typesnumeric.html">
numerical operations</a>. Additionally you can use the functions and constants
defined in the 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-math.html">math module</a>.
</p>

<p>
For kinetic laws which are not mass-action, the propensity function
must be a valid C++ expression. Both Python and C++ use the C math library,
so the syntax is almost the same. One difference to note: C++ does not
support the power operator <tt>x**y</tt>. Use <tt>pow(x, y)</tt> instead.
You can use any of standard math functions without the <tt>std</tt>
namespace qualification as well as the constants <tt>pi</tt> and <tt>e</tt>.
Of course you can also use the model parameters. Use the species identifiers
to denote the species populations.
