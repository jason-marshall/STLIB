<h1>Installation on RedHat 5.4 or CentOS 5.4</h1>

<!--
CentOS 5.4 32-bit:
Install updates.
Package Manager install: kernel-devel rpm-build
  Development Libraries and Development Tools
Download and install dkms-2.1.1.0-1.noarch.rpm

In a terminal:
  su
  cd /media/VBOX...
  sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run
Installing the VB additions did not appear to work, but it worked upon
rebooting.

<p>
To install Cain, first ensure that you have a C++ compiler and the
appropriate Python packages. (See below.) Then follow the
instructions for <a href="InstallationLinux.htm">installation on
linux/unix</a>.
</p>

<p>
First ensure that you have a C++ compiler.
In the Package Manager install
<tt>Development Libraries</tt> and <tt>Development Tools</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Because <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat 5.4</a> and
<a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS 5.4</a> are
&quot;enterprise&quot; Linux distributions, they have an old version
of Python (version 2.4.3).
It is recommended that you upgrade to a more recent version.
The easiest approach is to install the
<a href="http://www.enthought.com/">Enthought Python Distribution</a>.
It includes all of the packages that Cain requires. There is a
free version for those associated with educational institutions.
Download and save the Enthought
Python Distribution installer file. You may either install for all users
or just for your own use. Let's assume the former. (If you do not have
administrator privileges, you can install EPD in your home directory.)
In a terminal switch to
superuser with &quot;su&quot;. Start the installation with something like
&quot;sh epd-6.0.1-rh5-x86.sh&quot;. During installation you will be
queried for an installation location.
Choose something appropriate like &quot;/usr/lib/python2.6&quot;.
After the installation you will need to prepend the path to EPD python
to your PATH environment variable.
To do this execute
&quot;export PATH=/usr/lib/python2.6/bin:$PATH&quot; in a terminal.
It will be convenient to add this definition to your .bashrc or
.bash_profile in your home directory. 
</p>


<p>
If you want to do things the hard way, it is also possible to use the version
of python that ships with CentOS 5.4.
Cain has some minor problems, but still works.
To get wxPython install 
<tt>Fedora Core 6, Python 2.4 common-gtk2-unicode</tt> and
<tt>Fedora Core 6, Python 2.4 gtk2-unicode</tt>
from the <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>
downloads page. To get numpy and matplotlib you will need to install
something like the following packages:
<ul>
  <li> python-numpy-1.0.1-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm
  <li> python-dateutil-1.1-3.el5.noarch.rpm
  <li> pytz-2006p-1.fc6.noarch.rpm
  <li> python-matplotlib-0.98.5.2-3.el5.i386.rpm
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you use an old version of python and plot any simulation output you may
see the following message in the shell:<br>
<tt>** (python:6182): WARNING **: IPP request failed with status 1030</tt><br>
I don't know what causes this error.
After you exit Cain you will need to press Ctrl-c in the shell to get the
prompt back.
