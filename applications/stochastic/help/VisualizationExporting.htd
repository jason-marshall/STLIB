<h1>Exporting Data</h1>

<p>
Clicking the data export button <img src="filesave.png">&nbsp;
in the simulation output panel will bring up the data export
configuration window shown below.

<p>
The data export configuration window is similar in functionality to
the plotting configuration window presented in the 
<a href="VisualizationPlottingTimeSeries.htm">Plotting Time Series Data</a>
section. It consists of two tabs, one for time
series output and one for histogram output. First we will consider the
former. At the top of the window is a drop-down box for choosing
the simulation output to export.
</p>

<p>
Below the output selection are two rows
of radio buttons. In the first row one selects whether to plot species
populations, cumulative reaction counts, binned reaction counts,
or all reaction events. For a given output type, not all of these
categories are relevent. For example one may export the reaction
events only if all reaction events were recorded during the simulation.
In the second row of radio buttons
one selects whether to plot trajectories or statistics. For the latter
the mean and optionally the standard deviation of the trajectory
curves are plotted.
</p>

<p>
Next is a grid which lists either the species or reactions in the
column headers. Here one may select the items to export. If one is 
exporting statistics one may choose which means, and optionally 
which standard deviations, to export.
Clicking on a grid cell will toggle the state. Left/right clicking
on a column header will select/deselect all of the items.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the data export configuration window one may select 
the delimiter for data fields in a row. Choosing a comma will result 
in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>
file (comma-separated values) with a default file extension of 
<tt>.csv</tt>. Choosing either a space or tab will result in a text 
file with a default file extension of <tt>.txt</tt>. Any of these 
file formats may be imported into spreadsheet programs like
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html">Calc</a>,
<a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/">Numbers</a>, or
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/excel/">Excel</a>.
</p>

<p>
For the histogram data tab there are no radio buttons for selecting
the data type to export. All of the histograms for the selected
species are written. This tab of the data export configuration window
is shown below.
