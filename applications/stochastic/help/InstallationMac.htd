<h1>Installation on Mac OS X</h1>

<p>
To install Cain, download the disk image and drag the application bundle to
your Applications folder (or wherever you want to place it). The example data
files are in the <tt>examples</tt> folder in the application bundle. They
are also packaged separately in the <tt>CainExamples</tt>
folder. You can drag this to a folder where you store data or documents.
To uninstall Cain, simply drag the <tt>Cain</tt> application to the Trash.
</p>


<p>
<b>Leopard.</b>
To use Cain you will need 
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>,
<a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">numpy</a>, and
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a>.
Unfortunately, Leopard (10.5) comes with rather old versions of the first
three and does not have matplotlib. There are several ways of obtaining the
necessary software to run Cain. The easiest solution is to install the
<a href="http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php">Enthought Python
Distribution</a>. Alternatively, you can install the appropriate
packages yourself. We consider these two alternatives below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Snow Leopard.</b>
There is a complication with using the system version of Python in
Snow Leopard (10.6). The default version of Python is a 64-bit
application and the wxPython libraries will only work with the 32-bit
version. The easiest solution is to install the Enthought Python
Distribution. Otherwise you can either install a 32-bit version of
Python from the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python web site</a>,
or you can configure the system version of Python to run in 32-bit
mode. For instructions on the latter search for
&quot;wxpython snow leopard.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<b>Enthought Python Distribution.</b>
As mentioned above the easiest way to get appropriate versions of
python and the required packages is to 
<a href="http://www.enthought.com/products/getepd.php">download</a>
the Enthought Python Distribution.
The EPD is designed for those working in scientific
computing and comes with all of the packages that Cain needs. It is a
commercial product, but is free for educational use
if you are associated with a degree-granting institution. (Click on
the &quot;Academic&quot; button at the bottom of the download page.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Installing Python packages yourself.</b>
The other option is to download and install the packages.
Get the software from the sites indicated above.
Just download the binaries; installation is a snap. For example, one could
download and install the following packages.
<ul>
  <li> <tt>python-2.6.5-macosx10.3-2010-03-24.dmg</tt>
  <li> <tt>wxPython2.8-osx-unicode-2.8.10.1-universal-py2.6.dmg</tt>
  <li> <tt>numpy-1.4.1-py2.6-python.org.dmg</tt>
  <li> <tt>matplotlib-0.99.1.1-py2.5-macosx10.5.dmg</tt>
</ul>
If you do not have the necessary packages installed, Cain will show an error
message when you attempt to launch the application.
</p>

<p>
<b>C++ compiler.</b>
In order to compile custom executables (either for kinetic laws that are
not mass-action or to speed up simulations that use mass-action kinetics)
you will need a C++ compiler. The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU GCC</a>
compiler is freely available, but it is not installed by default. You can
get it by installing the Xcode tools on your Mac OS X install disc.
Alternatively, you can download the Xcode package from the
<a href="https://connect.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</a>.
You will need to register for a free account. After that, log in and
follow the <tt>Downloads</tt> and the <tt>Developer Tools</tt> links.
Download and install Xcode 3.1. This will install the compilers as well
as Apple's integrated development environment.
