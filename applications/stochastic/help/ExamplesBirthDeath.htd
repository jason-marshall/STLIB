<h1>Birth-Death</h1>

<p>
Consider the linear birth-death process presented in Section 1.3 of
<a href="http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/d.j.wilkinson/smfsb/">Stochastic
Modelling for Systems Biology</a>. The text introduces some differences
between continuous, deterministic modelling and discrete, stochastic modelling.
Let <em>X(t)</em> be the population of bacteria which reproduce at a rate
of &lambda; and die at a rate of &mu;. The continuous model of this process
is the differential equation
</p>
<p align="center">
<em>
X'(t) = (&lambda; - &mu;) X(t),
X(0) = x<sub>0</sub>
</em>
</p>
<p>
which has the solution
</p>
<p align="center">
<em>X(t) = x<sub>0</sub></em> e<sup>(&lambda; - &mu;)<em>t</em></sup>.
</p>
<p>
We can numerically solve the continuous, deterministic model in Cain.
Open the file <tt>examples/cain/BirthDeath.xml</tt> and select the
<tt>Birth Death 0 1</tt> model, which has parameter values &lambda; = 0
and &mu; = 1. In the method editor, select the <tt>Time
Homogeneous</tt> and then the 
<tt>Time Series, Deterministic</tt> categories with the default
method (<tt>ODE, Integrate Reactions</tt>) and options 
(<tt>Runge-Kutta, Cash-Karp</tt>). In the method list give this method
an appropriate name, like &quot;Deterministic.&quot; 
Check that the species <em>X</em>
has been selected in the recorder panel. In the launcher panel set the
number of trajectories to 1 and
click the launch button <img src="launch.png">&nbsp;
to generate the solution. You can visualize the solution by clicking the
plot button <img src="plot.png">&nbsp; in the output list to bring up
the plotting configuraton window (shown below).
</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>
Add axes labels as shown above and then click the plot button. 
The population as a function of time is plotted below.

The ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration method in Cain 
actually solves a different formulation of the model than the population-based
formulation above.
for the method.)
As the method name &quot;<tt>ODE, Integrate Reactions</tt>&quot;
suggests, it integrates the reaction counts. Instead of combining the 
effect of the two reactions to formulate the problem in terms of the
species population <em>X</em>, the birth reaction <em>B</em> and the
death reaction <em>D</em> are each represented.
The birth-death process can be modelled with the following
set of differential equations:
</p>
<p align="center">
<em>
B'(t) = &lambda; X(t), B(0) = 0<br>
D'(t) = &mu; X(t), D(0) = 0<br>
X'(t) = B'(t) - D'(t), X(0) = x<sub>0</sub>
</em>
</p>
<p>
It is perhaps instructive to translate the equations into plain English.
<ul>
<li> The birth rate is &lambda. We start counting the number of births
  at the initial time <em>t = 0</em>.
<li> The death rate is &mu. We start counting the number of deaths
  at the initial time <em>t = 0</em>.
<li> The rate of change is the population <em>X</em> is the difference
  between the birth rate and the death rate. At the initial time
  <em>t = 0</em>, the population is <em>x<sub>0</sub></em>.
</ul>
For &lambda; &ne; &mu; the system of equations has the solution
</p>

<p align="center">
<em>B(t) = &lambda; x<sub>0</sub></em>
(1 - e<sup>(&lambda; - &mu;)<em>t</em></sup>) / (&mu; - &lambda;)<br>
<em>D(t) = &mu; x<sub>0</sub></em>
(1 - e<sup>(&lambda; - &mu;)<em>t</em></sup>) / (&mu; - &lambda;)<br>
<em>X(t) = x<sub>0</sub></em> e<sup>(&lambda; - &mu;)<em>t</em></sup>.
</p>

<p>
While the population solutions are the same, the reaction-based
formulation of the model carries more information than the
population-based formulation. The population depends only
on the difference &lambda; - &mu;. However, the reaction counts depend
on the two parameters separately. For &lambda; = 0 and &mu; = 1
no birth reactions occur.
</p>

<p>
While the reaction counts are calculated, by default they are not
recorded in the simulation output. Delete the solution
that we generated previously by clicking the delete button
<img src="cancel.png">&nbsp; in the simulation output panel.
Then select the reactions tab in the recorder panel and select both
the birth and death reactions. Now run the simulation again.
In the plotting window select the <tt>Cumulative reactions</tt>
radio button, move the legend to the upper left corner,
and change the Y axes label to &quot;Reaction Counts.&quot;
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="ExamplesBirthDeathDeterministicReactionsPlotWindow.png">
</p>

<p> 
Plotting will result in a figure like the one below.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="BirthDeath-0-1-ODE-Reactions.jpg">
</p>

<p>
For &lambda; = 10 and &mu; = 11, the population is the same, but the
reaction counts differ. Below is a plot of the reaction counts for this case.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Now consider the discrete stochastic model, which has reaction
propensities instead of deterministic reaction rates.
This model is composed of the birth reaction 
<em>X &rarr; 2 X</em> and the death reaction <em>X &rarr;</em> 0 which
have propensities &lambda;<em>X</em> and &mu;<em>X</em>, respectively.
First we will generate a trajectory that records all of the reactions.
Select the <tt>Birth Death 0 1</tt> model. Then clone the 
&quot;Deterministic&quot; method (with the clone button 
<img src="editcopy.png">) and rename it &quot;DirectAll.&quot;
For this method select the <tt>Time Homogeneous</tt> and 
<tt>Time Series, All Reactions</tt> categories with the default method
and options. Then generate a trajectory with
the launch button. Below is a plot of the species
populations. We see that the population changes by discrete amounts.

</p>

<p>
Below we use Cain to reproduce the results in the text that demonstrate how
increasing &lambda; + &mu; while holding &lambda; - &mu; = -1 increases the
volatility in the system. For each test, we generate an ensemble of five
trajectories and plot these populations along with the
deterministic solution. Note that hitting the &quot;Plot&quot; button 
in the plotting window adds to the current figure while 
&quot;New plot&quot; creates a new figure. Also note that you can
click on the grid elements and columns in the plotting window to 
customize the appearance of the curves.

For a simple problem like this we can store and visualize all of the
reactions. However, for more complicated models (or longer running
times) generating a suite of trajectories may involve billions of reaction
events. Storing, and particularly plotting, that much data could be
time consuming or just impossible on your computer. Thus instead of
storing all of the reaction events, one typically
stores snapshots of the populations and reaction counts at set points
in time. Again clone the &quot;Deterministic&quot; method and rename 
it to &quot;Direct.&quot; 
For this method select the <tt>Time Homogeneous</tt> and 
<tt>Time Series, Uniform</tt> categories with the default method
and options. In the reactions tab of the recorder panel select 
both reactions.
For each test, we generate an ensemble of ten
trajectories and plot the species populations and the cumulative
reaction counts. Note that because we are only sampling the
state, we don't see the same &quot;noisiness&quot; in the trajectories.

In the plotting window you may choose between a number of
visualization options. First you choose what to plot:
<ul>
  <li> <tt>Species</tt> - The species populations.
  <li> <tt>Cumulative Reactions</tt> - The cumulative reaction counts.
  <li> <tt>Binned Reactions</tt> - The reaction counts binned 
    for each frame.
</ul>
Next you choose how to display the data: either plot the trajectories
or plot their mean (and optionally their standard deviation).
Thus there are six ways of generating a plot for a given simulation
output. Below we show each of these for the
birth-death model with &lambda; = 3 and &mu; = 4.

After selecting the plotting method you can customize the appearance
by editing the table that lists the species or reactions. See the
<a href="VisualizationPlottingTimeSeries.htm">Plotting Time Series Data</a>
section of the
<a href="Visualization.htm">Visualization and Analysis</a> chapter
for details.

Consider how the value of &lambda; affects the population of X at time
t = 2.5. From the plots above it appears that with increasing &lambda; there
is greater variance in the population, and also a greater likelihood of
extinction (X = 0). However, it is not possible to quantify these
observations by looking at trajectory plots. Recording histograms of the state
is the right tool for this. Once more clone the
&quot;Deterministic&quot; method. This time rename the result
&quot;Histogram.&quot; Select the <tt>Time Homogeneous</tt> and 
<tt>Histograms, Transient Behavior</tt> categories with the default 
solver method and options. Since we are only interested in the population at
t = 2.5, we set the recording time to that value and set the number of frames
to 1. We set the number of bins to 128 to obtain a high resolution
histogram and launch a simulation with
100,000 trajectories for each value of &lambda;. In the plotting
window we switch to the histograms tab. When plotting histograms
you choose the species and the frame (time). You can also choose colors
and enter a title and axes labels if you like. The plot configuration
window is shown below.

</p>

<p>
The histograms for each value of &lambda; are shown below. We see that for
&lambda; = 0, the mode (most likely population) is 4, but for &lambda; =
3, 7, or 10, the mode is 0. The likelihood of extinction increases with
increasing &lambda;.
