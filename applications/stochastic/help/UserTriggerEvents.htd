<p>
Trigger events fire when the trigger predicate changes value from false
to true. This predicate is a Python expression that
may involve species amounts, compartment sizes,
parameter values, and the time. The triggers for each of these events
are checked following the firing of any reaction of the execution of
any event, and also before recording the state at a frame. The following
are examples of trigger predicates.

<pre>
x &gt; 10
x &lt;= 5 and t &gt; 10</pre>

<p>
If the delay is nonzero, then this value indicates the time that will 
elapse between the triggering and the execution of the event. Leaving this
field blank indicates a zero delay. The <tt>TT</tt> field stands for 
Trigger Time. If it is checked, then the assignments will be evaluated
at the trigger time instead of the execution time.
