<h1>Immigration-Death</h1>

<p>
Consider a system with a single species <em>X</em> and two reactions:
immigration and death. The immigration reaction is 0&rarr;<em>X</em>
with a unit propensity factor. The death reaction is <em>X</em>&rarr;0
and has propensity factor 0.1. Since both reactions use mass-action kinetic
laws, the propensities are 1 and 0.1 <em>X</em>, respectively.
Open the file <tt>examples/cain/ImmigrationDeath.xml</tt>. Select the
&quot;ImmigrationDeath&quot; model and the &quot;Direct&quot; method
and then generate 10 trajectories. Below is a plot of these trajectories.

<p>
The analogous deterministic process is <em>X</em>' = 1 - 0.1<em>X</em>.
We numerically solve this equation by selecting &quot;ODE&quot; in the
list of methods and generating a single trajectory. The solution is
shown below.

<p>
Note that both the stochastic model and the deterministic model have a
steady state behavior. For the latter the solution approaches a
stationary point as time increases. We can determine
the steady state solution algebraically by setting <em>X</em>'
to zero and solving
for <em>X</em>, which yields <em>X</em> = 10.
</p>

<p>
The stochastic system does not have the same kind of steady state solution
as the continuous model. At steady state, there is a probability
distribution for the population of <em>X</em>.
To determine this distribution we will record the state in a time
averaged histogram. First select &quot;ImmigrationDeath10&quot;
from the model list, for which the initial population has been set to 10.
Then select &quot;SteadyState&quot; from the list of methods.
From the simulation parameters in the method editor you can see that
the system is allowed to equilibrate for 100 seconds and then the
state is recorded for 10,000 seconds. Generate 10 trajectories and
then plot the resulting empirical probability distribution using
the histograms tab of the plot configuration window. The result is
shown below.

<p>
From the plot we can see that the distribution is close to a normal
distribution and is centered near
<em>X = 10</em>.  We can obtain statistics on the distribution by
clicking the table button <img src="x-office-spreadsheet.png">&nbsp;
and selecting the &quot;Mean and standard deviation&quot; option.
From this we see that the mean is 9.96 and that the standard deviation
is 3.20.
</p>

<p>
Next one might consider the accuracy of the empirical probability distribution
for the steady state solution. Since the solution is recorded
in multiple histograms, we can estimate the error in the combined
result. Click the table
button <img src="x-office-spreadsheet.png">&nbsp; and select
&quot;Estimated error.&quot; The result depends upon the stream of random
number used, I got an estimated error of 0.0071. This indicates that the
histogram is fairly accurate and captures the typical behavior of the system.
We could obtain a more accurate answer by generating more trajectories.
