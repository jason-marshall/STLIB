In this panel you select the number of trajectories that you would
like to generate and the number of cores to use.  On startup Cain
detects the number of cores in your computer and sets the parameter to
this value. You may reduce the number of utilized cores if you want to
reserve more processing power for other applications. For example,
this may be a good idea if you want to watch a video while running
your simulation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Launching simulations.</b><br>
There are two ways to launch simulations; you can use 
either the launch button <img src="launch.png">&nbsp;
or the compile and launch button <img src="compile.png">.
Depending on the method you have selected, the launch button
<img src="launch.png">&nbsp; will either launch the simulation using
a C++ solver or a Python solver
that can handle events. Consider the methods that use C++ solvers.
If your model uses only mass-action kinetics, then a pre-built
mass-action solver will be launched. Otherwise, a custom solver
will be compiled and then launched.
One may force compilation of a custom solver by clicking the
compile-and-launch button. Compilation typically takes a few seconds. If you
entered any propensity functions which are not proper C++ expressions,
you will be notified of the compilation errors.
Note that you can set the compilation options through the preferences button
<img src="preferences-system.png">&nbsp; in the main tool bar.
The custom solvers are typically a little faster than the pre-built
mass-action solvers, but the difference is usually not significant.
However, if you are generating many trajectories it may be
worthwhile to compile a custom solver.
The mass-action solvers use a function that can evaluate
kinetic laws with any stoichiometry. Evaluating this function is not as
fast as evaluating a specific propensity function.
</p>

<p>
<b>Stopping simulations.</b><br>
When a simulation is running, the fraction of trajectories that have
been generated is shown in the progress bar. You can abort a running
simulation with <img src="stop.png">. This will wait for
each processes to finish generating its current trajectory and then
exit.  The trajectories that have been generated up to that point will
be stored.  You can also kill a simulation
with <img src="cancel.png">.  This will kill the solver
processes and store the partial results if possible. Note that you can
repeatedly launch suites of simulations to accumulate more trajectories. You
don't have to calculate them all in a single run.
</p>

<p>
<b>Running from the command line.</b><br>
You can run simulations from the command line if you want. This may be
useful if you want to use several computers to generate the output.
(See the <a href="DeveloperCommand.htm">Command Line Solvers</a>
section.)  First export a solver with
<img src="utilities-terminal.png">.  You have the option of
exporting a custom solver or a generic mass-action solver.
A custom solver is specific to the selected model. A generic solver may
be used with any model that has mass-action kinetics.
Next export ascii input files with the export jobs button
<img src="filesave.png">. This will write an input file for
each process; the trajectories will be split between the processes.
Each file contains a description of the selected model and method
as well as the number of trajectories.  Suppose you 
export a solver to <tt>solver.exe</tt>. Then you enter 1000 trajectories
and 4 processes in the launcher window and export the job with a base name
of <tt>batch</tt>. This will create the solver inputs: 
<tt>batch_0.txt</tt>, <tt>batch_1.txt</tt>, <tt>batch_2.txt</tt>, and
<tt>batch_3.txt</tt>.
You can generate the trajectories for the first batch with the command:
<pre>
./solver.exe &lt;batch_0.txt &gt;trajectories_0.txt
</pre>
You can import the simulation results with the import trajectories
button <img src="fileopen.png">. (Make sure that you have selected
the correct model and method before doing so.)
See the <a href="DeveloperFile">File Formats</a> section for specifications of
the input and output file formats.
</p>

<p>
<b>Using Mathematica.</b><br>
If you select the &quot;Mathematica&quot; method in the methods
editor, the export jobs button changes to the export to Mathematica
button <img src="mathematica.png">.
The Mathematica notebook defines the ODE's that describe the reactions
and species populations as well as commands for numerically solving
the set of ODE's and plotting the results. The final section in the
notebook has commands for saving times series data from the solution in a text
file. You can import this in Cain with the import trajectories
button <img src="fileopen.png">.
</p>

<p>
<b>Importing statistics.</b><br>
If you have selected either the &quot;Statistics, Transient
Behavior&quot; or the &quot;Statistics, Steady State&quot; output
category in the method editor, then all of the buttons in the
launcher, except for the import button <img src="fileopen.png">,
will be disabled. This is because there are no Cain solvers for
these output categories. They serve as placeholders for externally
generated solutions. One may import the solutions in a text file.
See the <a href="UserMethodEditor.htm">Method Editor</a> section
for details.

<p>
Now we will consider two advanced topics: task granularity and job priority.
If you are an advanced user conducting computationally expensive simulations,
then these topics may be of interest. Otherwise, just ignore the two sliders
in the launcher panel and skip the rest of this section.
</p>

<p>
<b>Task granularity.</b><br>
The first slider in this panel lets you select the task
granularity. Suppose that you want to generate 20,000 trajectories
using 2 processing cores. Cain will launch two solvers and then send
them tasks (requests to generate a certain number of trajectories)
until all of the trajectories have been generated. Note that there are
many ways of dividing up the 20,000 trajectories. Of course the
simplest approach is to request that each core generate 10,000. However,
this may not give the best performance because one core may be busy
with other tasks. Also, some trajectories may take longer to simulate
than others. Dynamic task scheduling often improves performance.  Here
one breaks the problem of generating all of the trajectories into a
number of tasks. Cain hands out tasks and waits for the solvers to
finish with them.  When a solver finishes, it receives another. This
continues until the job is complete. So how many trajectories should
comprise a task? If generating a single trajectory is computationally
expensive, then trajectories should be generated one at a time. This
minimizes the time at the end of the job when one core has finished
with all of its tasks, but the other core is still
working. Unfortunately this strategy does not work well when
generating a single trajectory is cheap. In this case the overhead of
handing out tasks could be more expensive than generating the
trajectories. Now it might be best for a task to be 100 or 1,000
trajectories.
</p>

<p>
The size of the tasks (relative to the whole job size) is the task
<em>granularity</em>. Small tasks are fine grained; large tasks are
coarse grained. If one puts the granularity slider to the left, the
trajectories will be generated one at a time. If one puts it to the
right, the trajectories will be divided amongst the available cores
and generated in a single task.  The default position of the slider is
in the middle. Here the task size is the square root of the number of
trajectories divided by the number of cores.  For our example above,
trajectories would be generated 100 at a time. The default granularity
is fine for most scenarios. However, if you are generating many
trajectories and each one is expensive, it is probably best to put the slider
to the left.
</p>

<p>
<b>Job priority.</b><br>
The slider at the bottom of the launcher panel allows you to set
the priority of the solvers. (Mac OS X and Linux users may be familiar with
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_(Unix)">nice</a> program,
which allows one to set the priority of a process.) By default, the solvers are
launched with the lowest possible priority. This way your computer will
remain responsive. You can continue to work with Cain, check your email, or
surf the web. If your computer is not busy with other tasks, launching with
a low priority has a negligible effect on the running time of the simulations.
