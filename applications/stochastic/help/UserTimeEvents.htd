<p>
The identifier and name for a time event are analogous to those for a
species. By default the name field is hidden.
The <tt>Times</tt> field is a list of times at which the event fires.
(One may enter a single number if the event fires only once.) One may use
Python expressions to generate the list of times. The following expressions 
are equivalent:
</p>
<pre>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
range(5)
[i for i in range(5)]</pre>

<p>
Now for a more complicated example. Suppose you want to fire an event
every tenth of a second between times <i>t=3</i> and <i>t=4</i> inclusive.
The appropriate list follows.
</p>
<pre>
[3+0.1*i for i in range(11)]</pre>

<p>
The assignments for an event are a sequence of single assignments, 
separated by semicolons. The syntax for a single assignment is
<tt>identifier = expression</tt>. The identifier must be a species,
compartment, or parameter identifier. The assignment sets the amount
of the species, the size of the compartment, or the value of
the parameter, respectively. The right hand side is a Python
expression that may involve
species amounts, compartment sizes, parameter values, and time
(denoted with the variable <i>t</i>).
The following are valid assignments:
</p>

<pre>
x = 7
x = x+1
x = 2*x; y = 0.1*t
</pre>
