<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>
Cain comes with a collection of example data files in the
<tt>examples</tt> folder. (Besides being packaged with the
application, the examples are available as a separate download.)  Open
one of these files, <tt>examples/cain/BirthDeath.xml</tt> for example.
(The <a href="ExamplesBirthDeath.htm">birth/death model</a> is
presented in the examples section.)  You will see lists of the defined
models and methods in the first two panels.  When you select a model,
its species, reactions, etc. are shown in the model editor panels in
the bottom two rows of the application window.  Select a model and a
method. Then select the species and/or reactions to record. 
You can generate a suite of
trajectories with the launch button <img src="launch.png">&nbsp;
in the launcher frame. A description of the output will appear in the
top, right panel.
</p>

<p>
Play around with the buttons and panels. Most of the text labels and buttons
have tool tips describing their functionality. Just pause the cursor over an
object to see what it does. Hopefully, most of the widgets do
what you expect. Note that you must have a model and a method selected
in order to launch a simulation. When you get stuck or confused, come
back here and continue reading this manual.
</p>

<p>
Note that there are horizontal splitters between the rows of panels, and also
vertical splitters between the model editor panels.
These appear differently on each operating system. On Mac OS X, splitters are
indicated with what appears to be a small indentation at their centers.
You can click and drag the splitters to change the ratio of space allocated
to the rows and panels.
