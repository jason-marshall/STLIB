<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<p>
The status bar at the bottom of the main window does not work correctly on
OS X, so the tool tips are not displayed. This is a known issue with
wxPython.

<p>
Version 2.8.9.2 of wxPython may not correctly display tables in the
documentation. I would recommend using version 2.8.9.1. You can also view the
PDF version (available as a download) for the correct output.
