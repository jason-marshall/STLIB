<h1>Solvers</h1>

<p>
In this section we enumerate and briefly describe each of Cain's solvers.
See the <a href="Simulation.htm">Simulation Methods</a> section for more details
and derivations. In the <a href="UserMethod.htm">method editor</a> the
solvers are grouped according to four heirarchical categories: time
dependence, simulation output, algorithm, and option. One choose a
solver by selecting items from each of these in turn.
</p>

<a name="TimeDependence"><h2>Time Dependence</h2></a>

<p>
The first category differentiates between time homogeneous and time
inhomogeneous systems. In a time homogenous problem the reaction
propensities do not have explicit time dependence. Time inhomogenous
problems typically arise when the volume or temperature have a
prescribed time dependence. This implies that the reaction rates will
explicitly depend on time. Cain has many solvers for time homogeneous
problems, but few for time inhomogenous ones. While conceptually very
similar, one uses different algorithms for the two cases.  Thus in
choosing a solver one first selects the time dependence category.
</p>

<a name="SimulationOutput"><h2>Simulation Output</h2></a>

<p>
Next one selects the desired simulation output. The various kinds of output
are described in the <a href="UserMethod.htm">Method Editor</a> section.
To recap, one can either collect time series or histogram data.
For time series data one can either record the state at uniformly spaced
time frames or one can record every reaction event. Although Cain is
primarily for stochastic simulations, it does offer a few simple deterministic
solvers. These generate time series data and are grouped in a separate
category. When the species populations are recorded in histograms,
the mean and standard deviation are also recorded. This is useful because
unless the bin width is unity one can only approximately calculate these
statistics from the histogram data.
For histogram output one can either study transient or steady
state behavior. For the former one records the state at uniformly spaced
frames in time. For the latter one averages the populations over
a specified time interval. Thus, in summary there are five simulation output
categories:
<ul>
  <li>
  <tt>Time Series, Uniform</tt>.
  Here one takes snapshots of the state of uniformly spaced frames in time.
  One can use either exact methods like the
  <a href="SimulationDirect.htm">direct method</a>,
  <a href="SimulationFirst.htm">first reaction method</a>, and
  <a href="SimulationNext.htm">next reaction method</a>,
  or approximate methods such as 
  <a href="SimulationTau.htm">tau-leaping</a> and
  <a href="SimulationHybrid.htm">hybrid direct/tau-leaping</a>.
  Recently there has been much research in optimized exact methods.
  (See reference [<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>]
  for an analysis.) Thus we
  offer many different formulations of the direct and next reaction methods.
  You may experiment to see how the various formulations perform. However,
  the default formulation has good performance for most problems.
  <li>
  <tt>Time Series, All Reactions</tt>.
  Recording every reaction event is useful when one wants a visual
  representation of the amount of noise in a system. By contrast, when one
  records the state at frames one does not get a picture of the magnitude of
  the random fluctuations. Note that recording every reaction is expensive,
  and plotting the results is even more so. For this output option we use
  the 2-D search formulation of the direct method.
  <li>
  <tt>Time Series, Deterministic</tt>.
  Deterministic systems are modeled with a set of ordinary differential
  equations. Cain uses <a href="SimulationOde.htm">numerical integration</a>
  to approximately solve the system. The state is recorded at uniformly
  spaced time frames.
  <li>
  <tt>Histograms, Transient Behavior</tt>.
  If one records the state at time frames one can of course plot the
  trajectories. One can also analyze the species populations at these
  frames. One can compute the mean and standard deviation of the population
  or one can plot the distribution of populations in a histogram. Obtaining
  accurate statistics or distribution data usually requires generating many
  trajectories. In this case, the state information may require a lot of
  storage capacity. It is more economical to dynamically update population
  statistics and a histograms of the species populations as the trajectories
  are being generated. For this output category populations statistics and
  histogram data is stored at uniformly spaced frames in time. To generate
  the trajectories we use the 2-D search formulation of the direct method.
  <li>
  <tt>Histograms, Steady State</tt>.
  If one records every reaction event, one can analyze the steady state
  behavior of a system. One could take the time average of the species
  populations to determine the mean and standard deviation of the steady
  state populations. One could also record the time weighted populations
  in a histogram to determine the distribution of steady state populations.
  However, storing every reaction event typically requires a lot of storage.
  It is more efficient to dynamically update statistics and histogram data
  as the trajectories are generated. For this output option the time averaged
  statistics and histogram data is collected. Again we use the 2-D search
  formulation of the direct method to generate the trajectories.
</ul>
</p>
<!--CONTINUE Show little plots for each output option.-->

<a name="Algorithms"><h2>Algorithms</h2></a>

<p>
The third category in selecting a solvers is the simulation algorithm.
There are algorithms for exact and approximate stochastic simulation.
Below is a list with some implementation details.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <tt>Direct</tt>.
  Gillespie's
  <a href="SimulationDirect.htm">direct method</a>
  [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gillespie1976">Gillespie 1976</a>]
  [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gillespie1977">Gillespie 1977</a>].
  A reaction dependency graph 
  [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gibson2000">Gibson 2000</a>]
  is used to minimize the cost of recomputing propensities.
  Unless otherwise indicated, the sum of the propensities and associated
  quantities are dynamically updated. 
  At each step the time increment is determined by drawing an exponential
  deviate. The mean of the distribution is the sum of the propensities.
  The reaction is chosen by
  generating a discrete deviate whose weighted probability mass function
  is the set of reaction propensities. There are many options for
  generating the discrete deviate. The 2-D search formulation is the default
  method.
  <li>
  <tt>Next Reaction</tt>.
  Gibson and Bruck's
  <a href="SimulationNext.htm">next reaction method</a>
  [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gibson2000">Gibson 2000</a>] stores reaction
  times in a priority queue. There are several options for implementing
  this data structure.
  <li>
  <tt>First Reaction</tt>.
  Gillespie's
  <a href="SimulationFirst.htm">first reaction method</a>
  [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gillespie1976">Gillespie 1976</a>]
  [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gillespie1977">Gillespie 1977</a>].
  <li>
  <tt>Tau-Leaping</tt>.
  We implement explicit <a href="SimulationTau.htm">tau-leaping</a>
  with the step size selection presented
  in reference [<a href="Bibliography.htm#cao2006a">Cao 2006a</a>].
  <li>
  <tt>Hybrid Direct/Tau-Leaping</tt>.
  This hybrid algorithm uses the direct method for the volatile (low
  population) species and tau-leaping for the rest.
  <li>
  <tt>ODE, Integrate Reactions</tt>.
  For <a href="SimulationOde.htm">ODE integration</a>
  we use 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-Kutta">Runge-Kutta</a>
  schemes.
</ul>


<a name="Options"><h2>Options</h2></a>

<p>
Below is a list of the available solvers grouped according to the
heirarchical categories.
Each of the solvers use sparse arrays for the state change vectors
[<a href="Bibliography.htm#li2006">Li 2006</a>].
The methods that require exponential deviates use the ziggurat method 
[<a href="Bibliography.htm#marsaglia2000">Marsaglia 2000</a>].
<ul>
  <li>
  <h3><tt>Time Homogeneous</tt></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <h4><tt>Time Series, Uniform</tt></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <h5><tt>Direct</tt></h5>
      The computational complexities for generating discrete deviates
      and for modifying propensities are indicated for each method in
      terms of the number of reactions <em>M</em>.
      <ul>
	<li>
	<tt>2-D search</tt>
	- Generate O(<em>M<sup>1/2</sup></em>). Modify O(1).
	The propensities are stored in a 2-D table that stores the sum of each
	row. The number of rows (and hence the number of columns) is
	O(<em>M<sup>1/2</sup></em>). The discrete deviate is generated by
	first determining the appropriate row with a linear search and then
	performing a linear search within that row
	[<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>]. 
	<li>
	<tt>2-D search, sorted</tt>
	- Generate O(<em>M<sup>1/2</sup></em>). Modify O(1).
	The propensities are periodically ordered so the larger values have
	smaller
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance">Manhattan
	distance</a> from the lower corner of the table than smaller
	values
	[<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>].
	For some problems this may reduce the costs of
	searching.
	<li>
	<tt>2-D search, bubble sort</tt>
	- Generate O(<em>M<sup>1/2</sup></em>). Modify O(1).
	The propensities are dynamically ordered each time they are modified
	[<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>].
	<li>
	<tt>Composition rejection</tt>
	- Generate O(1).  Modify O(1).
	Propensities are placed in groups. In each
	group the propensities differ by at most a factor of two. A deviate
	is generated by a linear search on the groups followed by selecting
	a reaction within a group with the method of rejection.
	This solver implements a slightly modified version of the composition
	rejection method presented in [<a href="slepoy2008">Slepoy 2008</a>].
	<li>
	<tt>Binary search, full CMF</tt>
	- Generate O(log <em>M</em>). Modify O(<em>M</em>).
	The cumulative mass function (CMF) is stored in an array. This allows
	one to generate a discrete deviate with a binary search on that array.
	At each time step the CMF is regenerated. This is an implementation
	of the logarithmic direct method [<a href="li2006">Li 2006</a>].
	<li>
	<tt>Binary search, sorted CMF</tt>
	- Generate O(log <em>M</em>). Modify O(<em>M</em>).
	In this solver the reactions are arranged in descending order
	according to the sum of the propensities of the influencing
	reactions
        [<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>].
        This minimizes the portion of the CMF that one has
	to recompute after firing a reaction and updating the
        influenced propensities.
        <li>
        <tt>Binary search, recursive CMF</tt>
        - Generate O(log <em>M</em>). Modify O(log <em>M</em>).
        Instead of storing the full CMF, a partial, recursive CMF is used.
        This approach is equivalent to the method presented in
        [<a href="gibson2000">Gibson 2000</a>]. A deviate can be generated
        with a binary search. Modifying a propensity affects at most
        log<sub>2</sub> <em>M</em> elements of the partial, recursive CMF.
        <li>
        <tt>Linear search</tt>
        - Generate O(<em>M</em>). Modify O(1).
        We use a linear search on the PMF to generate a deviate. The sum of
        the propensities is dynamically updated.
        <li>
        <tt>Linear search, delayed update</tt>
        - Generate O(<em>M</em>). Modify O(1).
        This solver recomputes the sum of the propensities at each time step
        as done in the original formulation of the direct method
        [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gillespie1977">Gillespie 1977</a>].
        <li>
        <tt>Linear search, sorted</tt>
        - Generate O(<em>M</em>). Modify O(1).
        The propensities are periodically sorted in descending order
        [<a href="Bibliography.htm#mccollum2005">McCollum 2005</a>].
        <li>
        <tt>Linear search, bubble sort</tt>
        - Generate O(<em>M</em>). Modify O(1).
        The propensities are dynamically ordered by using swaps each time
        a propensity is modified
        [<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>].
      </ul>
      <li>
      <h5><tt>Next Reaction</tt></h5>
      Each formulation below uses a different data structure to
      implement the priority queue. The computational complexities for
      removing an element and modifying an element are given in terms
      of the number of reactions <em>M</em>.
      <ul>
        <li>
	<tt>Hashing</tt>
	- Pop O(1). Modify O(1).
	The indexed priority queue is implemented with a hash table
	[<a href="Bibliography.htm#cormen2001">Cormen 2001</a>,
	<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>]. We use hashing
	with chaining,
	which means that each bin in the hash table contains a list of
	elements. The hash function is a linear function of the putative
	reaction times, truncated to an integer to obtain a bin index.
	The hash function is dynamically adapted to obtain the target load.
	(The <em>load</em> is the average number of elements in each bin.)
	<li>
	<tt>Binary heap, pointer</tt>
	- Pop O(log <em>M</em>). Modify O(log <em>M</em>).
	This solver uses a binary heap that is implemented with an array
	of pointers to the putative reaction times. This is the data structure
	used in [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gibson2000">Gibson 2000</a>].
	<li>
	<tt>Binary heap, pair</tt>
	- Pop O(log <em>M</em>). Modify O(log <em>M</em>).
	We use a binary heap implemented with an array of index/time pairs
	[<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>].
	The pair version of the binary heap typically has better performance
	than the pointer version on 64-bit architectures. Vice versa for
	32-bit architectures.
	<li>
	<tt>Partition</tt>
	- Pop O(<em>M<sup>1/2</sup></em>). Modify O(<em>M<sup>1/2</sup></em>).
	A splitting value is used to divide the reactions two categories
	[<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>].
	The splitting value is chosen so that initially there are
	O(<em>M<sup>1/2</sup></em>) reactions in the lower partition.
	The remainder are in the upper partition. In determining the minimum
	putative reaction time, one only has to examine reactions in the
	lower partition. When the lower partition is empty, a new splitting
	value is chosen.
	<li>
	<tt>Linear search</tt>
	- Pop O(<em>M</em>). Modify O(1).
	The putative reaction times are stored in an array. We use a linear
	search to find the minimum
	[<a href="Bibliography.htm#mauch2009">Mauch 2009</a>].
      </ul>
      <li>
      <h5><tt>First Reaction</tt></h5>
      Gillespie's first reaction method
      [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gillespie1976">Gillespie 1976</a>]
      [<a href="Bibliography.htm#gillespie1977">Gillespie 1977</a>].
      <ul>
	<li>
	<tt>Simple</tt>
	- A simple implementation of the method.
	<li>
	<tt>Reaction influence</tt>
	- We use the reaction influence data structure to minimize recomputing
	the propensities.
	<li>
	<tt>Absolute time</tt>
	- We use absolute times instead of waiting times for each reaction.
	This allows us to reduce the number of exponential deviates used.
	After firing a reaction, we only generate new reaction times for the
	influenced reactions.
      </ul>
      <li>
      <h5><tt>Tau-Leaping</tt></h5>
      All of the tau-leaping solvers have first order accuracy. They differ in
      how they calculate the expected propensities, whether they correct
      negative populations, and how they calculate the time step. For calculating
      the expected propensities one may use a first, second, or fourth order
      Runge-Kutta scheme. (The first and second order schemes are commonly
      called forward and midpoint, respectively.)
      While all yield a first order stochastic method, using
      a higher order scheme is typically more efficient. Use the adaptive step
      size solvers unless you are studying the effect of step size. With a fixed
      step size it is difficult to predict the accuracy of the simulation.
      With the adaptive step size solvers you may choose whether or not to
      correct negative populations. Without correction, some portion of the
      simulations may fail.

      </ul>
      <li>
      <h5><tt>Hybrid Direct/Tau-Leaping</tt></h5>
      With these solvers you can choose the scheme for calculating the expected
      propensities.

      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>
    <h4><tt>Time Series, All Reactions</tt></h4>
    The direct method with a 2-D search is used when recording each reaction
    event.

    <li>
    <h4><tt>Time Series, Deterministic</tt></h4>
    When generating a single deterministic trajectory one can either use a
    built-in solver or export the problem to a Mathematica notebook.
    The solvers use
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-Kutta">Runge-Kutta</a>
    schemes. For ordinary work, use the
    adaptive step size
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash-Karp">Cash-Karp</a> variant,
    which is a fifth order method. The rest of the solvers are only useful
    in studying how the order and step size affect the solution.

      Each of the following use the direct method with a 2-D search.
      <ul>
	<li>
	<tt>Elapsed time</tt> - 
	This is the most efficient method for most problems. The algorithm
	keeps track of when species change values in order to minimize the cost
