In this panel you can edit the compartments.
The identifier and size fields are required;
the name field is optional. The sizes of compartments may be used
in the same way as <a href="UserParameter">parameter</a> values.
Recall that compartments are
optional in Cain. If a species is not assigned to a compartment, it is
automatically put in an unnamed compartment.
