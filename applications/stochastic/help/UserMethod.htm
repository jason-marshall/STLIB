The methods list panel, shown above, has much the same functionality
as the models list.  The simulation methods are listed by their
identifiers.  When a method is selected, the categories that define
the simulation method as well as the simulation parameters such as the
starting time and recording time are shown in the method editor panel
to the right.  Recall that if a simulation method with associated
parameters has been used in a simulation, you cannot edit or delete it
without first deleting the dependent output. However, you can change
its name by clicking twice on the identifier.
