  \page derivative Derivative Package

  The derivative package has functions for calculating
  \ref derivative_ridders "derivatives and gradient"
  using Ridders' method.
  There are also functions and functors that evaluate the centered
  difference formula
  \ref derivative_centered_difference "derivatives" and
  \ref gradient_centered_difference "gradients".
