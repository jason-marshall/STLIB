  \page ads_array Array Package

  The array package has several array classes:
  - ads::FixedArray has the array size and the element type as template
    parameters.  It is used to represent Cartesian points in several packages.
  - ads::Array is an N-D, dynamically-sized array.  The dimension and
    the element type are specified as template parameters.
    It may either allocate its own memory or wrap externally allocated memory.
  - ads::SparseArray is an N-D dynamically-sized, sparse array.  For 1-D
    (\ref ads_array_SparseArray1 "SparseArray<1,T>") it
    uses index compression.  For higher dimensions
    (\ref ads_array_SparseArray2 "SparseArray<2,T>")
    it uses index/offset compression.
  - ads::ArrayWithNullHoles is a dynamically-sized, 1-D array with holes.
    It supports efficient deletion of elements and insertion of elements
    into holes.

  The ads::IndexRange class is used to specify the index ranges of arrays.

  The array classes are STL-compliant containers.  (Consult
  "Generic Programming and the STL" by Matthew H. Austern.)  Such containers
  define the following nine types:
  - \c value_type
  - \c pointer
  - \c const_pointer
  - \c reference
  - \c const_reference
  - \c iterator
  - \c const_iterator
  - \c difference_type
  - \c size_type
  .
  STL-compliant containers provide accessors to the beginning and
  end of the range of elements:
  - <tt>const_iterator begin() const</tt>
  - <tt>const_iterator end() const</tt>
  .
  as well as the corresponding manipulators:
  - <tt>iterator begin()</tt>
  - <tt>iterator end()</tt>
  .
  There are three member functions relating to the number of elements
  in the container.
  - <tt>size_type size() const</tt>
  - <tt>bool empty() const</tt>
  - <tt>size_type max_size() const</tt>
  .
  Finally there is a member function for swapping the contents of two
  containers.
  - <tt>void swap(container&)</tt>

  Each array class supports the
  standard mathematical operations.  The ads::FixedArray class does not
  share implementation with the dynamic arrays.

  There are two policy classes which implement functionality for ads::Array:
  - ads::ArrayContainer manages the array size, the beginning and the end of
    the element storage and container indexing.  This class either allocates
    memory or references external memory.  The functions that
    operate on the array elements are implemented in this class.
  - ads::ArrayIndexing defines the index ranges, indexing, and file output.
