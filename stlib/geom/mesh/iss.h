  \section iss_Data Mesh Data Structures

  geom::IndSimpSet implements an indexed simplex set. It is composed of an
  array of vertices and an array of indexed simplices. Below is a mesh
  of the unit square. The vertex indices are labelled outside the square.
  The indices inside indicate the order of the vertices for the three
  triangles.

  \image html square.jpg "A mesh of the unit square."
  \image latex square.pdf "A mesh of the unit square."

  This mesh is represented as an array of vertices:
  \verbatim
  0.0 0.0
  1.0 0.0
  1.0 0.5
  1.0 1.0
  0.0 1.0 \endverbatim
  and an array of indexed simplices.
  \verbatim
  0 1 2
  0 2 4
  2 3 4 \endverbatim

  The geom::IndSimpSetIncAdj class inherits from geom::IndSimpSet and
  stores additional topological information. It uses
  container::StaticArrayOfArrays to store vertex-simplex incidences and
  a vector of std::array's to store simplex adjacencies.
  Geometric mesh optimization capabilities are implemented using this
  augmented data structure.

  For the above unit square, the vertex-simplex incidences are:
  \verbatim
  0 1
  0
  0 1 2
  2
  1 2 \endverbatim
  Note that for each vertex, the incident simplex indices are stored
  in sorted order. This makes it easier to apply set operations. For
  example, the set of simplices that are incident to an edge is the
  intersection of the sets that are incident to the two end vertices.
  Recall that you can use the \c std::set_intersection() function
  to form the intersection of two sets that are represented as
  sorted sequences.

  The simplex adjacencies are represented as:
  \verbatim
  max 1  max
  2  max 0
  max 1  max \endverbatim
  where \c max represents the value \c std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max()
  and indicates no adacent neighbor. (Another way to represent this value is
  \c std::size_t(-1).) For example, triangle 0 has no
  adjacent neighbors opposite its first and third vertices and has triangle 1
  opposite its second vertex.

  Consider an (N-1)-D manifold \f$ s \f$ in N-D space (perhaps a curve in
  2-D or a surface in 3-D.)  The manifold can be described \em explicitly
  or \em implicitly. An explicit description could be
  parametric. For example, the unit circle is:
  \f[
  \{ (x,y) : x = \cos(\theta), y = \sin(\theta), 0 \leq \theta < 2 \pi \}
  \f]
  A simplicial mesh is also an explicit description of a manifold.

  For some purposes an implicit description of a manifold is more
  useful. One common implicit representation is a
  <em>level set function</em>.
  For example, the unit circle is the set of points on which the function
  \f$ f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 \f$ is zero.
  This level set function is useful for determining if a point is inside
  or outside the circle. If \f$ f(x,y) \f$ is negative/positive then the
  point \f$ (x,y) \f$ is inside/outside the circle.

  One special kind of level set function is a
  <em>signed distance function</em>.
  \f$ d(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 1\f$ is a signed
  distance function for the unit cirle. That is, the value of the function
  is the distance to the circle. The distance is negative inside the
  circle and positive outside.

  A related concept is a <em>closest point function</em>. As the name
  suggests, the function evaluates to the closest point on the manifold.
  For the unit circle, the closest point function is
  \f[
  c(x,y) = \frac{(x,y)}{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2} } \ \mathrm{ for }\  (x,y) \neq (0,0)
  \f]
  \f[
  c(x,y) = (1,0) \ \mathrm{for}\ (x,y) = (0,0)
  \f]
  (Note that the closest point is not uniquely determined for
  \f$ (x,y) = (0,0) \f$.)


  Consider a manifold that is the boundary of an object.
  A distance function for the manifold can be used to determine if a
  point is inside or outside the object. Or it can be used to determine
  if a point is close the boundary of the object. The closest point function
  is useful if points need to be moved onto the boundary.

  The geom::ISS_SignedDistance class computes the distance to a simplicial
  mesh and the closest point on the simplicial mesh. It stores the simplices
  is a bounding box tree. It efficiently computes distance and closest point
  by using a technique called a lower/upper bound query. This class is
  used both in mesh generation and in geometric optimization of boundary
  vertices.

  Use the indexed simplex set classes by including the file geom/mesh/iss.h or
  by including geom/mesh.h .

  \section iss_Mesh_Quality Mesh Quality

  We assess the quality of a mesh in terms of the quality of its
  elements. The \f$ \ell_p \f$ norm of the quality metric over all
  tetrahedra gives the quality of the mesh. We can use the \f$ \ell_2
  \f$ norm to obtain an average quality or the \f$ \ell_\infty \f$
  norm to measure the worst element quality.

  The operations we apply to optimize the mesh are local. They only
  affect the complex of tetrahedra which are adjacent to a node, edge or face.
  We use the \f$ \ell_p \f$ norm to measure the quality of the complex.


  <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  \section iss_Node_Location Geometric Optimization of a Node Location

  The tetrahedra adjacent to an interior vertex \f$ v \f$ form a complex.
  We move \f$ v \f$ to optimize the \f$ \ell_p \f$ norm of the quality
  metrics of the simplices in the complex.

  \image latex geom_opt_complex.pdf "2-D illustration. The complex is shown in green." width=0.5\textwidth

  We have investigated using optimization methods that do not require
  derivative information. These have the advantage that one can
  optimize the \f$ \ell_\infty \f$ (max norm) of the quality metric.
  We implemented the downhill simplex method and the coordinate
  descent method. However, we have found that optimizing the \f$ \ell_2 \f$
  norm with a quasi-Newton method (BFGS) is more robust and much
  more efficient.


  <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  \section iss_Boundary_Nodes Geometric Optimization of Boundary Nodes

  For impact/penetration problems, the greatest deformation occurs at
  the boundary. It is not possible to arrange the interior nodes to obtain
  a quality mesh if the boundary nodes have poor geometry. Thus we
  extended the geometric optimization to boundary nodes.


  One approach is to optimize the position of the boundary node and then
  project it onto the boundary curve/surface. We use an implicit
  representation of the boundary. The projection is done with the
  closest point function.

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  \section iss_Content_Constraint Constant Content Constraint

  Another approach is to conserve the content (volume in 3-D) of the complex
  of simplices
  adjacent to the boundary node. This is easy to implement and conserves
  mass. We use a penalty method combined with a quasi-Newton optimization.
  (We use the same optimization method as for interior nodes. Only the
  objective function changes by adding a penalty.)

  \image html volume_constraint.jpg "Boundary node optimization subject to a constant volume constraint."
  \image latex volume_constraint.pdf "Boundary node optimization subject to a constant volume constraint." width=0.7\textwidth

  A boundary node should be moved only if the surface is approximately
  planar at the node.
  In the first example, the surface at the boundary node is planar. Thus
  the boundary shape is unchanged. In the second example, there is a large
  difference between the adjacent boundary edge normals. This leads to
  a large change in the shape of the boundary.

  \section iss_Optimization Geometric Optimization

  The user chooses the movable set of nodes. They may choose all or a subset
  of the interior or boundary nodes.
  The user may use the condition number or mean ration metrics or supply
  their own metric.

  We have implemented several hill climbing methods for sweeping over the
  nodes of the mesh. One can sweep over all movable nodes.
  Or one can sweep over movable nodes that have an adjacent
  tetrahedron with poor quality.

  These hill climbing methods apply local changes to the mesh. They rapidly
  improve deformations that are local in nature. It may take many iterations
  to converge if the nodes are widely re-distributed.
