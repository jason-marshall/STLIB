  <b>Features of Manifolds.</b>

  This class represents a 2-manifold in 3-D space.  It models the manifold
  with a triangle mesh.  Consider the Enterprise model shown below.  The
  boundary of the model is a 2-manifold.  Consider a point on this
  manifold.  If a neighborhood of the point is diffeomorphic a neighborhood
  of the origin in the plane \f$\{x = 0\}\f$,
  then we call the point a <em>smooth feature</em>.  For those who have
  forgotten the definition of diffeomorphic (or for those who don't care
  what it means), we can proceed concurrently with intuitive definitions.
  If a point is part of a smooth portion of the surface, then it is on a
  smooth feature.

  \image latex enterprise.pdf "The Enterprise."

  Next we define edges.  Consider the manifold \f$E\f$ that is the union of
  the two
  half planes \f$\{z = 0, y \geq 0\}\f$ and \f$\{y = 0, z \geq 0\}\f$.
  The two half planes meet along the \f$x\f$ axis.  We call this line an edge.
  We use this as our canonical example of an edge.
  If a neighborhood of a point on a manifold is diffeomorphic to a
  neighborhood around the origin on \f$E\f$, then the point is on an
  <em>edge feature</em>.  Of course you already knew what an edge was,
  but wasn't it fun to define it?

  Finally we consider corners.  This one is easy.  If a point is not on
  a smooth feature nor an edge feature, then it is on a
  <em>corner feature</em>.

  Smooth features are 2-manifolds (surfaces) and edge features are 1-manifolds
  (curves).  Corner features are typically 0-manifolds (points).  I have
  to say "typically" because one can conceive of weird 2-manifolds where the
  corner features cluster to form higher dimensional manifolds.  Go ahead
  and ponder such possibilities if you like, but I am going to steer clear
  of the esoteric and show some simple examples.

  Consider the boundary of a cube
  (shown below).  The interiors of its 6 square faces are smooth feature.
  The interiors of its 12 line segment edges are edge features.
  The cube has 8 corner features.  The corner features arise from intersecting
  edge features.

  \image html cube.jpg "A cube."
  \image latex cube.pdf "A cube."

  Next consider the boundary of a cone (shown below).  It has a circular
  edge feature and one corner feature.  The remainer is composed of two
  smooth features.
  Now you can see why we defined corner features in terms of what they are not
  (smooth features and edge features) instead of what they are.  Since we
  defined edge features by intersecting two planes we could have tried to
  define corner features
  by intersecting several planes.  This would work for corners that arise
  from intersecting edges, but it does not work for the corner feature
  of the cone.

  \image html coneBelow.jpg "A cone.  View from below."
  \image latex coneBelow.pdf "A cone.  View from below."

  Now we have defined features for 2-manifolds in 3-D space.  Pretty easy,
  wasn't it?  We even used mathematical definitions which could easily be
  made rigorous.  The problem is that these manifolds are mythical beasts
  which only exist in our imaginations.  In real life, we deal with triangle
  meshes, which are 2-manifolds as well, but which represent (approximate)
  the mythical manifolds.  Next we will consider surface, edge, and corner
  features in the context of triangle meshes.

  <b>Features of Meshes.</b>

  Below is a triangle mesh that represents the boundary of the enterprise.
  A triangle mesh is defined in terms of nodes (points in space) and elements
  (triples of nodes that form triangles).  Because the define the geometry
  of the mesh, we would like to characterize the nodes.  If we treat the
  mesh as a (peicewise linear) 2-manifold and apply the results from above
  we will be dissapointed.  With this approach, almost all of the nodes in the
  Enterprise example are corner features.  This is because the nodes are
  where multiple planes (defined by the incident triangles) intersect.
  There is a special case when all of the incident triangles are co-planar.
  Then the node is a surface feature.  One could also get an edge feature when
  the incident triangles each lie in one of two planes.  As predicted, this
  is vexing.  The classification of the node has nothing to do with how the
  associated point on the mythical manifold would be classified.  In going
  from the mythical manifold to the triangle mesh, we have lost information.
  We certainly don't have enough information to get derivatives, hence the
  whole diffeomorphic thing is right out the window.  We cannot determine for
  sure whether a node corresponds to a surface, edge, or corner feature.
  The best that we will be able to do is make a reasonable guess.

  \image html enterpriseBoundary.jpg "A triangle mesh that represents the boundary of the Enterprise."
  \image latex enterpriseBoundary.pdf "A triangle mesh that represents the boundary of the Enterprise."

  To get the ball rolling, we will need to consider edges in the triangle mesh
  instead of single nodes.  An interior edge in the triangle mesh has two
  incident
  triangle faces.  Consider the dihedral angle defined by these two triangle
  faces.  If the angle has a large deviation from \f$\pi\f$ there are two
  possibilities.
  -# The points on the interior of the line segment correspond to points
  on an edge
  feature on the mythical manifold.  The edge in the mesh is then a linear
  approximation of the associated portion of this edge feature.
  -# The mesh is a poor approximation of the mythical manifold near the edge.
  This could happen because the mesh is too coarse to capture the features
  of the manifold.  For example, the points on the edge could correspond
  to points on a surface
  feature where the surface has relatively high curvature (relative to the
  edge lengths in the mesh).

  To keep the ball rolling, we need to be optimistic.  If the dihedral angle
  at an edge in the mesh has a large deviation from \f$\pi\f$, we \e hope
  that the edge corresponds to a portion of an edge feature in the mythical
  manifold.  If not, the mesh is a poor approximation of the manifold, and
  that makes anything that we do with the mesh rather pointless.

  Note the vague language of "large deviation."  This vagueness is a necessity.
  What is large will depend on the mesh and how well we think it approximates
  the mythical manifold.  We will explore this issue with some examples later
  on.

  Now we have a method of determining which edges in a mesh we are going to
  call edge features.  First we pick a deviation \f$\alpha\f$.  Then if
  \f$|\theta - \pi| > \alpha\f$ where \f$\theta\f$ is the dihedral angle at
  an edge, then we have an edge feature.  What does this tell us about the
  two nodes at the ends of the edge?  Well, they are certainly not surface
  features.  But they may be either edge features or corner features.
  If a specified interior node has two incident edge features, then the
  node is on
  an edge feature.  If it has more than two incident edge features,
  then it is on a corner feature.  For instance, the node at the corner of
  a cube would have three incident edge features.  If the node has one incident
  edge feature, it is also on a corner feature.  To justify this, we go back
  to the mythical manifold and consider an edge feature that has a "free end",
  i.e. it terminates at a point where it does not intersect other edge
  features.  Since this endpoint is clearly not a surface feature or
  an edge feature, it must be a corner feature.  In summary:
  - If a node has 0 incident edge features we will, for the time being,
  consider it to be on a surface feature.  (We are being non-commital because
  we have only considered corner features that arise from intersecting or
  terminating edges.)
  - If a node has 2 incident edge features, it is on an edge feature.
  - Otherwise, the node is on a corner feature.

  Now we deal with corner features that do not arise from intersecting
  or terminating edge features, for example the point of a cone.  For this
  we examine the solid angle an an interior node.  If this angle has
  a large deviation from \f$2 \pi\f$, then the node is on a corner feature.

  If the triangle mesh is not closed, then we need to classify its boundary
  nodes.  In this case, the boundary of the triangle mesh is a line segment
  mesh.  To classify the boundary nodes of the triangle mesh we
  will use our classification scheme for 1-manifolds in
  3-D space (see \ref PointsOnManifoldN11T).  We measure the angle
  between the two incident boundary edges.  If it has a large deviation
  from \f$\pi\f$ then the node is on a corner feature.  If the boundary
  node has any incident edge features, it is also on a corner feature.
  Otherwise the node is on a surface feature.

  To summarize, three parameters give us a reasonable way of determining
  which edges of a triangle mesh are edge features and classifying each
  of the nodes as being on a surface feature, an edge feature or a corner
  feature.  These three parameters are the dihedral devation, the solid
  angle deviation, and the boundary angle deviation.

  We have just done quite a bit of deriving.  It's time to give our brains
  a rest and look at some pictures.  Consider the Enterprise mesh above.
  This was generated in Cubit using a target edge length of 20 meters.
  We will use a range of dihedral angle deviations to extract the features
  of the mesh and hopefully extract features of the model.  In the figures
  below we show the edge features in white and the corner features in red.

  We start with a dihedral angle deviation of 0.1 (radians).  This picks up
  a lot of spurious edge and corner features (along with the "genuine"
  features).

  \image html enterpriseFeatures0.1.jpg "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.1."
  \image latex enterpriseFeatures0.1.pdf "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.1."

  When we increase the dihedral angle deviation to 0.2, we get fewer
  spurious features.

  \image html enterpriseFeatures0.2.jpg "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.2."
  \image latex enterpriseFeatures0.2.pdf "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.2."

  Likewise for 0.3.

  \image html enterpriseFeatures0.3.jpg "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.3."
  \image latex enterpriseFeatures0.3.pdf "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.3."

  When we increase the dihedral angle deviation to 0.4, the spurious features
  are almost gone, but we have also lost a legitimate edge feature.  We
  no longer detect one of the large circular edge features.

  \image html enterpriseFeatures0.4.jpg "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.4."
  \image latex enterpriseFeatures0.4.pdf "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.4."

  When we go to 0.5, there are no spurious features.

  \image html enterpriseFeatures0.5.jpg "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.5."
  \image latex enterpriseFeatures0.5.pdf "Features derived from a dihedral angle deviation of 0.5."

  As we increase the dihedral angle deviation more, we lose more of the
  legitimate features.
