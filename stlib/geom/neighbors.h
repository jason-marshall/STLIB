  \page geom_neighbors Neighbor Search Package

  The the neighbor search sub-package has classes for performing various neighbor searches for points in N-D:
  - geom::FixedRadiusNeighborSearch
  - geom::FixedRadiusNeighborSearchWithGroups

  Use this sub-package by including the desired class or by including
  the file neighbors.h.
