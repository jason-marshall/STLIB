\page geom_mesh_ingredients The Five Essential Ingredients of Mesh Optimization

There are five essential ingredients to any program of mesh optimization:
- Element quality metric.
- Geometric optimization.
- Topological optimization.
- Element size control.
- Boundary description.


<b>Element Quality</b>

The quality of a mesh is measured in terms of the quality of its
elements.  Thus one needs a metric for assessing element quality.
Simply put, an element that is close to the ideal shape (perhaps an
equilateral tetrahedron) has good quality and an element that is
far from the ideal shape has poor quality.  Below are poor quality
tetrahedra that are nearly co-linear or co-planar.

\image html poor_quality_tetrahedra.jpg "Poor quality tetrahedra."
\image latex poor_quality_tetrahedra.pdf "Poor quality tetrahedra."


<b>Geometry</b>


The positions of the nodes defines the geometry of a mesh.  If the nodes
are not well-spaced, then it is not possible to connect them to make
quality elements.  Any mesh optimization program must be able to improve
the geometry of the mesh.

Below is a mesh with good geometry.  The nodes are connected to form
quality triangles.

\image html ing_geom_good.jpg
\image latex ing_geom_good.pdf

Next consider a mesh with bad geometry.  Note that there is no way of
forming quality elements with these node positions.  One is forced to
make skinny triangles along the bottom of the square.

\image html ing_geom_bad.jpg
\image latex ing_geom_bad.pdf



<b>Topology</b>

The connectivity of the nodes to form elements defines the topology
of a mesh.  If a mesh has poor topology, then no course of geometry
optimization alone could yield a high quality mesh.  Below is
a mesh with good topology and relatively poor topology.

\image html ing_top_good.jpg
\image latex ing_top_good.pdf

\image html ing_top_bad.jpg
\image latex ing_top_bad.pdf



<b>Element Size</b>

For most applications, it is not sufficient that a mesh have well-shaped
elements. the elements must also satisy size requirements.  For finite
element applications, elements that are too large increase the error
and elements that are too small increase the cost of the computation.

Consider the following three meshes.  In terms of element shape, they have
the same quality.  However, the meshes are clearly not equivalent.

\image html ing_size_large.jpg
\image latex ing_size_large.pdf

\image html ing_size_small.jpg
\image latex ing_size_small.pdf

\image html ing_size_non_unif.jpg
\image latex ing_size_non_unif.pdf



<b>Boundary</b>

Finally, consider the following mesh of the circle.

\image html ing_boundary_initial.jpg
\image latex ing_boundary_initial.pdf

If we were to refine the triangles, it would no longer be the mesh of a
circle; it would be the mesh of a hexagon.

\image html ing_boundary_refined.jpg
\image latex ing_boundary_refined.pdf

It is apparent that if we change the mesh, we need a means of keeping the
boundary nodes on the boundary curve.

\page geom_mesh_overview An Overview of the Simplicial Mesh Package.

\section geom_mesh_overview_introduction Introduction.

This package contains a suite of hill-climbing methods for mesh optimization.
That is, each method sweeps over the mesh, investigating local changes.
If the proposed transformation locally improves the quality of the mesh,
then the change is accepted.  The local changes are comprised of
geometric transformations (moving vertices)
and topological transformations (changing the connectivities).

There are also refinement and coarsening capabilities.
Refinement is done with edge splitting; coarsening with edge collapse.
These are used for error control and efficiency, respectively.

A \ref geom_mesh_advantagesMWF "feature-based representation"
of the boundary is used in many of the mesh
optimization algorithms.  For a 3-D mesh, the boundary is represented
as a triangle mesh that has surface features, edge features, and corner
features.  Sharp edges and corners are preserved as nodes are moved
and cells are modified.

One can use either an explicit (parametric) or an
implicit (level set) description of the boundary.  The explicit
description is useful for moving points along the boundary.
For the level set description, the boundary
is stored in a bounding box tree, which supports efficient minimum
distance queries.  In this manner the distance to the boundary and
the closest point on the boundary may be determined for any point in
space.  This representation of the boundary enables moving nodes
onto the boundary.

\section geom_mesh_overview_algorithms Algorithms.

The following algorithms are currently implemented in 2-D and 3-D.

- Algebraic quality metrics.
These metrics are functions of the Jacobian
matrix  of the mapping from the equilateral simplex to the physical simplex.
They are differentiable and sensitive to all types of degeneracies.
- Geometric optimization of vertex positions.
A vertex is moved to
optimize the quality of the incident simplices.  Boundary vertices
are moved along the feature-based description of the boundary.
Alterntively, boundary vertices may be
optimized subject to a constant content constraint or may be
optimized and then constrained to remain on a specified curve/surface.
- Topological optimization.
Local transformations (edge flips in 2-D,
edge removal and face removal in 3-D) are applied in a hill-climbing
strategy.
- \ref geom_mesh_refinement "Refinement".
One can refine a set of cells or refine the mesh based on a maximum
allowed edge length function.
If a cell is targeted for refinement, its longest edge
will be split.  However, only mutual longest edges are allowed to be split.
This means that adjacent cells may need to be (recursively) refined
before the targeted cell is refined.
- Coarsening.
The mesh is coarsened by removing cells through edge collapse.
One can coarsen the mesh by collapsing edges for a set of cells or by
specifying a minimum allowed edge length function.  There are
user-defined parameters for controlling the quality of the mesh while
performing coarsening.
- Conversion of a simplicial mesh to a level set function.
There is a data
structure that allows a mesh to be treated as a distance function or a
closest point function.  It combines a lower-upper bound
query on a bounding box tree with distance and closest point calculations
to the elements of the mesh.
- Mesh transfer.
There is a robust mesh transfer algorithm
for transfering fields from one simplicial mesh to another.  Given a
point and a field, the algorithm first determines the simplex to
which the point has minimum distance.  The distance could be
negative or positive depending on whether the point is inside or
outside the simplex.  Then one can perform interpolation or extrapolation
with the fields defined in the simplex.  The minimum distance
calculation uses a lower-upper bound query on a bounding box tree
which has expected complexity \f$\log N\f$ where \f$N\f$ is the
number of simplices.

\section geom_mesh_overview_dataStructures Data Structures.

There are mesh data structures for both static topology and dynamic topology.
(See the \ref geom_mesh_data "data structures page" for details and
comparisons.)
The static topology data structures
(geom::IndSimpSet and geom::IndSimpSetIncAdj)
are used in geometric optimization, the level
set capability, and boundary description.  The dynamic topology data
structure (geom::SimpMeshRed) is used
in topological optimization, refinement and coarsening.  The data structures
are light-weight, and flexible.   The space dimension, simplex dimension
(triangle, tetrahedron, etc.), as well as the node and element types
are specified as template parameters.  We anticipate that
these data structures will be sufficient for future algorithmic
development.

The boundary manifold data structures are
\ref PointsOnManifold321T "geom::PointsOnManifold<3,2,1,T>" and
\ref PointsOnManifoldN11T "geom::PointsOnManifold<N,1,1,T>",
for 3-D and 2-D, respectively.
They capture the features of the boundary.  In 3-D, the boundary has
surface, edge, and corner features.  Nodes may be moved along the boundary,
inserted in the boundary, or deleted from the boundary.



\section geom_mesh_overview_futureWork Future Work.

- Add more quality functions.
- Combine geometric optimization with topological optimization to form
more general transformations for the hill-climbing optimization approach.
- Make refinement more efficient by avoiding deep recursion.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*!
\page geom_mesh_organization Organization of the Simplicial Mesh Package.

Algorithms for mesh optimization fall into three categories.
- Geometric optimization: Vertices are moved to improve mesh quality.
The topology is unchanged.
- Topological optimization: Reconnect the vertices to form different cells
with better quality.  This changes the topology of the mesh, but the
geometry remains constant.
- Coarsening and refinement: Coarsen the mesh by collapsing edges;
refine the mesh by splitting edges.  These operations change both
the geometry and topology of the mesh.

The simplicial mesh package is composed of three sub-packages:
- The \ref geom_mesh_simplex has quality functions for simplices.
- The \ref iss has support for mesh generation and geometric optimization.
It also has data structures for effeciently computing distance to meshes.
- The \ref simplicial has support for topological optimization, coarsening,
and refinement of simplicial meshes.

Each of these sub-packages has a header file in the \c geom/mesh directory.
You can include all of the sub-packages by including the file
\c geom/mesh.h .

\section geom_mesh_data_mesh Simplicial Mesh Data Structures.

The position of the nodes (vertices) defines the \em geometry of a mesh.
The connection of the nodes to form elements, faces and edges defines the
\em topology of a mesh.


Let N be the space dimension and M be the simplex
dimension.  For a tetrahedral mesh in 3-D, N = 3 and M = 3.  The boundary
of this tetrahdral mesh is a triangle mesh with N = 3 and M = 2.
There are three mesh data structures:
- geom::IndSimpSet, Indexed Simplex Set.
- geom::IndSimpSetIncAdj, Indexed Simplex Set with Incidence and Adjacency
information.
- geom::SimpMeshRed, Simplicial Mesh, Reduced representation.
.
These data structures have
the space dimension and the simplex dimension as template parameters.

geom::IndSimpSet implements an indexed simplex set.  This is a economical
representation of a mesh.  It is composed of an array of vertices
and an array of indexed simplices.  A \em vertex is an N-tuple of numbers (a
Cartesian point).  An \em indexed \em simplex
is represented by an (M+1)-tuple of vertex indices.
From these, one can make a \em simplex: an (M+1)-tuple of vertices.
The indexed simplex set is well suited for
implementing algorithms in which the topology of the mesh does not
change.  The ``cookie cutter'' mesh generation and file I/O are implemented
using the geom::IndSimpSet data structure.

Note that the only topological information stored in geom::IndSimpSet
is the simplex-vertex incidencies.  One needs more information
to perform geometric optimization of vertices.
There are auxillary data structures for
storing vertex-simplex incidencies (geom::VertexSimplexInc)
and simplex-simplex adjacencies (geom::SimplexAdj)
The geom::IndSimpSetIncAdj class inherits from geom::IndSimpSet and
has geom::VertexSimplexInc and geom::SimplexAdj as data members.
Geometric mesh optimization capabilities are implemented using this
augmented data structure.

geom::SimpMeshRed is a \em reduced mesh representation.  A
\em full mesh representation stores all of the topological entities.
For a tetrahedral mesh, there are tetrahedral cells, triangle faces,
edges, and vertices.  geom::SimpMeshRed (short for Simplicial Mesh
Reduced) stores only the top and bottom level entities.  The
intermediate entities (edges for triangle meshes, faces and edges
for tetrahedral meshes) are represented implictly.  This approach
has the advantage that the data structure can be general in the
space dimension and simplex dimension.  It also reduces the storage
requirements.

geom::SimpMeshRed supports algorithms in which the topology of the
mesh changes.  The data structure is composed of a container of nodes
and container of cells.  The \em node type is a template parameter
for the mesh.  A node stores at least a vertex and an iterator to itself.
In addition, it may store an integer identifier and iterators to one or all
of the incident cells.  The \em cell type is also a template parameter
for the mesh.  A cell stores at least a simplex of its nodes
(technically a simplex of node iterators) and an
iterator to itself.  In addition, it may store an integer identifier and
iterators to the adjacent cells.  The container type is also a template
parameter of the mesh.  It is required that inserting and removing
elements does not invalidate iterators.  By default, the container type
is std::list.

\section geom_mesh_data_manifold Manifold with Features Data Structures.

To represent the boundary of a model, one uses a "manifold with features"
data structure.  The boundary of a triangle mesh in 2-D is a line segment
mesh.  In this case, one can represent the boundary with
\ref PointsOnManifoldN11T.  The boundary of a tetrahedral mesh in 3-D
is a triangle mesh in 3-D.  Here one can represent the boundary with
\ref PointsOnManifold321T.  One can also use \ref PointsOnManifold321T
to represent the geometry of your model when working with 3-2 meshes
(triangle meshes in 3-D).

/*!
\page geom_mesh_refinement Mesh Refinement

Mesh refinement is accomplished through edge splitting.  In 2-D, an edge
is incident to either one or two triangles (boundary edges and
internal edges, respectively).  To split the edge, we insert a node at
the midpoint of the edge.  The midpoint is connected to the opposite
nodes of the incident triangles.  In the figure below we split an internal
edge.

\image html edge_split_2.jpg "Splitting an edge in 2-D."
\image latex edge_split_2.pdf "Splitting an edge in 2-D."

In 3-D, an edge is incident to one or more tetrahedra.  To split the
edge, we insert a node at the midpoint of the edge.  The midpoint is
connected to each of the nodes of the incident tetrahedra which are
not incident to the edge being split.  (If the edge is incident to
\f$n\f$ tetrahedra, the the midpoint of the split node is incident
to \f$2 n\f$ tetrahedra.)  In the figure below we split an edge of a
tetrahedron.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
\section geom_mesh_cubeStretchTwistDistorted The Distorted Mesh.

We start with a mesh of a unit cube.  It has 8,007 cells.
The edges of the tetrahedra have lengths close to 0.1.
(Each of the figures below show the modified condition number of the
elements.)

\verbatim
cp ../../../data/geom/mesh/33/cube_1_1_1_0.1.txt mesh.txt \endverbatim

\image html cubeStretchTwistMesh.jpg "The initial mesh of the cube.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.58; the mean is 0.86."
\image latex cubeStretchTwistMesh.pdf "The initial mesh of the cube.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.58; the mean is 0.86."

Then we distort the mesh by stretching it along the z axis by a factor of 2
and twisting it around the z axis by an angle of \f$\pi\f$.

\verbatim
python.exe ../../../data/geom/mesh/utilities/vertices_map.py stretch mesh.txt distorted.txt
python.exe ../../../data/geom/mesh/utilities/vertices_map.py twist distorted.txt distorted.txt \endverbatim

\image html cubeStretchTwistDistorted.jpg "The distorted mesh.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.16; the mean is 0.59."
\image latex cubeStretchTwistDistorted.pdf "The distorted mesh.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.16; the mean is 0.59."



<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
\section geom_mesh_cubeStretchTwistGT Topological and Geometric Optimization.

First we apply topological optimization.  We use a dihedral angle deviation
of 0.5 to define edge features.  Intersecting edge features are corner
features.

\verbatim
utility/boundary33.exe distorted.txt boundary.txt
optimization/topologicalOptimize3.exe -manifold=boundary.txt -angle=0.5 r1.txt r1t1.txt \endverbatim

\image html cubeStretchTwistT1.jpg "The mesh after topological optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.19; the mean is 0.68."
\image latex cubeStretchTwistT1.pdf "The mesh after topological optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.19; the mean is 0.68."

Next we apply one sweep of geometric optimization.

\verbatim
optimization/geometricOptimize3.exe -boundary=boundary.txt -dihedralAngle=0.5 r1t1.txt r1t1g1.txt \endverbatim

\image html cubeStretchTwistT1G1.jpg "The mesh after geometric optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.28; the mean is 0.73."
\image latex cubeStretchTwistT1G1.pdf "The mesh after geometric optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.28; the mean is 0.73."

Finally, we apply an additional cycle of topological and geometric
optimization.

\verbatim
optimization/topologicalOptimize3.exe -manifold=boundary.txt -angle=0.5 r1t1g1.txt r1t2g1.txt
optimization/geometricOptimize3.exe -boundary=boundary.txt -dihedralAngle=0.5 r1t2g1.txt r1t2g2.txt \endverbatim

\image html cubeStretchTwistT2G2.jpg "The mesh after two cycles of topological and geometric optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.41; the mean is 0.78."
\image latex cubeStretchTwistT2G2.pdf "The mesh after two cycles of topological and geometric optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.41; the mean is 0.78."

We see that the optimization has significantly improved the quality of the
mesh.  However, because of the distortion, the cells are on average about
twice as large as in the original mesh.  The following sections use
refinement to deal with this.


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
\section geom_mesh_cubeStretchTwistRL Refinement Based on Edge Length.

We refine the mesh to deal with the stretching.  We split any edges that
are longer than 0.2.  This results in a mesh with 20,867 cells.

\verbatim
optimization/refine33.exe -length=0.2 -manifold=boundary.txt -angle=0.5 distorted.txt r1.txt \endverbatim

\image html cubeStretchTwistRL1.jpg "The mesh after refinement based on edge length.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.18; the mean is 0.63."
\image latex cubeStretchTwistRL1.pdf "The mesh after refinement based on edge length.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.18; the mean is 0.63."

Next, as we did above, we apply two cycles of topological and geometric
optimization.

\image html cubeStretchTwistRL1T2G2.jpg "The mesh after refinement based on edge length and two cycles of topological and geometric optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.40; the mean is 0.80."
\image latex cubeStretchTwistRL1T2G2.pdf "The mesh after refinement based on edge length and two cycles of topological and geometric optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.40; the mean is 0.80."

We see that the refinement has little affect on the final quality of the
mesh.  It only reduces the size of the cells.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
\section geom_mesh_cubeStretchTwistRQ Refinement Based on Cell Quality.

A different strategy is to refine the mesh based on cell quality.
We refine cells
that have have been significantly distorted.  To do this, we select the
cells with modified condition number less than 0.5.
This approach results in fewer edge splits than in the above section.
The refined mesh has 13,034 cells.

\verbatim
utility/cellAttributes33.exe -mcn distorted.txt mcn.txt
utility/selectCells.exe -upper=0.5 mcn.txt indices.txt
optimization/refineCells33.exe indices.txt distorted.txt rq1.txt \endverbatim

\image html cubeStretchTwistRQ1.jpg "The mesh after refinement based on cell quality.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.19; the mean is 0.60."
\image latex cubeStretchTwistRQ1.pdf "The mesh after refinement based on cell quality.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.19; the mean is 0.60."

Next, as we did above, we apply two cycles of topological and geometric
optimization.

\image html cubeStretchTwistRQ1T2G2.jpg "The mesh after refinement based on cell quality and two cycles of topological and geometric optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.41; the mean is 0.80."
\image latex cubeStretchTwistRQ1T2G2.pdf "The mesh after refinement based on cell quality and two cycles of topological and geometric optimization.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.41; the mean is 0.80."

In terms of mesh quality, refinement based on cell quality is little
different than no refinement or refinement based on edge length.

\page geom_mesh_cylinderTwist Twisted Cylinder Example

We start with a mesh of a cylinder.  It has unit height and radius 0.5.
The edges of the tetrahedra have lengths close to 0.1.  In the figures
below, we show the modified condition number of the elements.

\verbatim
cp ../../../data/geom/mesh/33/cylinder_0.5_1_0.1.txt mesh.txt \endverbatim

\image html cylinderTwistMesh.jpg "The initial mesh of the cylinder."
\image latex cylinderTwistMesh.pdf "The initial mesh of the cylinder."

For the boundary of the cylinder, we use a mesh that has triangle edge
lengths close to 0.05.  We define any dihedral angle that deviates more
than 0.5 from pi to be an edge feature.

\verbatim
cp ../../../data/geom/mesh/32/cylinder_0.5_1_0.05.txt boundary.txt \endverbatim

We start with a mesh of the unit cube.
The edges of the tetrahedra have lengths close to 0.1.  In the figures below,

We distort the mesh by moving the vertices according to the following

\page geom_mesh_cubePullCorner Cube with a Pulled Corner

We start with a mesh of the unit cube.
The edges of the tetrahedra have lengths close to 0.1.  We move the cube to
lie in the first octant.  In the figures below,
we show the modified condition number of the elements.

We distort the mesh by moving the vertices according to the following

\verbatim
x = x + x * x + y * y + z * z
y = y + x * x + y * y + z * z
z = z + x * x + y * y + z * z \endverbatim

The distortion reduces the quality of the mesh.

\image latex cubePullCornerDistorted.pdf "The distorted mesh.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.22; the mean is 0.82."

First we use refinement to deal with the edges that have been stretched by
pulling out the corner.  We split any edge longer than 0.2.

The optimization improves the quality of the mesh while retaining its edge
and corner features.  Vertices on surface features have been allowed to
move within their surface patches.  Vertices on edge features have
been allowed to move along edges.  Vertices on corner features have
been fixed.


Another refinement approach is to refine the cells that have become
distorted.  We refine the cells whose modified condition number is less
than 0.5.

\verbatim
utility/cellAttributes33.exe -mcn distorted.txt mcn.txt
utility/selectCells.exe -upper=0.5 mcn.txt indices.txt

\image latex cubePullCornerRQ1T0G0.pdf "The mesh after refinement based on cell quality.  There are 8,608 cells.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.21; the mean is 0.80."

We note that refining based on quality results in fewer edge splits
than the refinement above based on edge length.  Again we apply
cycles of topological optimization followed by a sweep of geometric
optimization to improve the quality of the distorted mesh.  In terms
of mesh quality, we obtain similar results to the refinement based
on edge length.

\page geom_mesh_advantagesMWF Advantages of the Manifold With Features Approach.

Here we consider an example that demonstrates the advantages of the
"manifold with features" approach.  We start with a mesh of the Enterprise.
(The following commands can be executed in \c stlib/examples/geom/mesh.
The \c stlib/results/geom/mesh/3/enterpriseManifold directory contains
a makefile which generates the figures in this example.)

\verbatim
cp ../../../data/geom/mesh/33/enterpriseL50.txt enterprise.txt \endverbatim

\image html advantagesMWFEnterprise.jpg "The initial mesh.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.069 the mean is 0.82."
\image latex advantagesMWFEnterprise.pdf "The initial mesh.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.069 the mean is 0.82."

We have a higher resolution mesh to describe the boundary.

\verbatim
cp ../../../data/geom/mesh/32/enterpriseL20.txt enterpriseBoundary.txt \endverbatim

\image html advantagesMWFEnterpriseBoundary.jpg "A higher resolution surface mesh of the Enterprise."
\image latex advantagesMWFEnterpriseBoundary.pdf "A higher resolution surface mesh of the Enterprise."

We apply two cycles of geometric and topological optimization to the mesh.
We optimize the modified condition number quality metric.
We use the boundary mesh, without using the features capability.  That is,
the boundary nodes of the solid mesh are only constrained to remain on the
surface mesh.

\verbatim

optimization/geometricOptimize3.exe -function=c -boundary=enterpriseBoundary.txt enterpriseNoFeatures.txt enterpriseNoFeatures.txt

\image html advantagesMWFEnterpriseNFTGTG.jpg "The mesh after two cycles of geometric and topological optimization.  Boundary features are not used.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.23 the mean is 0.87."
\image latex advantagesMWFEnterpriseNFTGTG.pdf "The mesh after two cycles of geometric and topological optimization.  Boundary features are not used.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.23 the mean is 0.87."

We see that the optimization has improved the quality of the mesh elements.
However, the result is not very satisfactory.  The shape of the object has
changed.  The distortion is most pronounced on the thin rectangular beams
and along the circular rim.

To rectify this problem, we utilize the edge features of the boundary mesh.
We define any edge with a dihedral angle which deviates more than 0.5 from
\f$ \pi \f$ to be an edge feature.  In the figure below we see that this
choice is large enough to capture the edge features of the boundary mesh
and small enough to not introduce spurious edge features.  Intersecting edge
features are corner features (shown in red).

\image latex advantagesMWFEnterpriseEdgesCorners.pdf "The edge and corner features of the boundary mesh for a dihedral angle deviation of 0.5."

Again we apply two cycles of geometric and topological optimization to the
mesh, but this time we use the features capability.  In short, this means:
- Boundary nodes on corner features cannot be moved by the geometric
optimization.
- Boundary edges cannot be modified by the topological optimization if
they lie along an edge feature.
- When boundary nodes on edge features are moved by the geometric
optimization, they must remain on edge features.
- When boundary nodes on surface features are moved by the geometric
optimization, they must not cross edge features.

\image html advantagesMWFEnterpriseTGTG.jpg "The mesh after two cycles of geometric and topological optimization.  Boundary features are used.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.11 the mean is 0.86."
\image latex advantagesMWFEnterpriseTGTG.pdf "The mesh after two cycles of geometric and topological optimization.  Boundary features are used.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.11 the mean is 0.86."

We see that the optimization has not improved the quality of the elements
as much as before, but the shape of the object has been accurately
maintained.

\page geom_mesh_enterpriseBoundarySurvey A Survey of Different Boundary Conditions in Geometric Optimization of the Enterprise Mesh.

Here we apply geometric optimization to a mesh using a variety of boundary
constraints.  We start with a mesh of the Enterprise that has 1,438 nodes
and 4,926 elements.
(The following commands can be executed in \c stlib/examples/geom/mesh.
The \c stlib/results/geom/mesh/3/enterpriseBoundarySurvey directory contains
a makefile which generates the figures in this example.)

\verbatim
cp ../../../data/geom/mesh/33/enterpriseL50.txt enterprise.txt \endverbatim

\image html ebsMesh.jpg "The initial mesh.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.069 the mean is 0.82."
\image latex ebsMesh.pdf "The initial mesh.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.069 the mean is 0.82."

We have a higher resolution mesh to describe the boundary.

\verbatim
cp ../../../data/geom/mesh/32/enterpriseL20.txt enterpriseBoundary.txt \endverbatim

\image html ebsBoundary.jpg "A higher resolution surface mesh of the Enterprise."
\image latex ebsBoundary.pdf "A higher resolution surface mesh of the Enterprise."


We apply apply one sweep of geometric optimization to the mesh.
We optimize the modified condition number quality metric.
First, we use an implicit description of the boundary.  To optimize a
boundary node, its position is first optimized in 3-D space and then
projected back onto its closest point on the boundary.  If the resulting
change locally improves the quality of the mesh, it is accepted.

\verbatim
optimization/geomOptBoundaryCondition3.exe -function=c enterpriseBoundary.txt enterprise.txt enterpriseImplicitSurface.txt \endverbatim

\image html ebsImplicitSurface.jpg "The mesh after optimization using the implicit surface method.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.19 the mean is 0.85."
\image latex ebsImplicitSurface.pdf "The mesh after optimization using the implicit surface method.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.19 the mean is 0.85."

\image html ebsImplicitSurfaceBack.jpg "The mesh after optimization using the implicit surface method.  View from the back."
\image latex ebsImplicitSurfaceBack.pdf "The mesh after optimization using the implicit surface method.  View from the back."

We see that the optimization has improved the quality of the mesh elements.
However, the result is not very satisfactory.  The shape of the object has
changed.  The distortion is most pronounced on the thin rectangular beams
and along the circular rim.



Next we try using a content constraint.  That is, when moving boundary
nodes the volume of the object remains constant.

\verbatim
optimization/geomOptContentConstraint3.exe -function=c enterprise.txt enterpriseContentConstraint.txt \endverbatim

\image html ebsContentConstraint.jpg "The mesh after optimization using the content constraint method.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.31 the mean is 0.87."
\image latex ebsContentConstraint.pdf "The mesh after optimization using the content constraint method.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.31 the mean is 0.87."

\image html ebsContentConstraintBack.jpg "The mesh after optimization using the content constraint method.  View from the back."
\image latex ebsContentConstraintBack.pdf "The mesh after optimization using the content constraint method.  View from the back."

Again the optimization has improved the quality of the mesh elements.
In this respect, it is more successful than with using the implicit
boundary method.  But again, the result is not very satisfactory.
The shape of the object has been preserved along its its smooth surfaces,
but it has been distorted near sharp edges in the model.



To rectify this problem, we utilize the edge features of the boundary mesh.
We define any edge with a dihedral angle which deviates more than 0.5 from
\f$ \pi \f$ to be an edge feature.  In the figure below we see that this
choice is large enough to capture the edge features of the boundary mesh
and small enough to not introduce spurious edge features.  Intersecting edge
features are corner features (shown in red).

\verbatim
utility/extractFeatures32.exe -angle=0.5 enterpriseBoundary.txt enterpriseEdges.txt enterpriseCorners.txt \endverbatim

\image html ebsEdgesCorners.jpg "The edge and corner features of the boundary mesh for a dihedral angle deviation of 0.5."
\image latex ebsEdgesCorners.pdf "The edge and corner features of the boundary mesh for a dihedral angle deviation of 0.5."

Now we optimize the mesh using the manifold with features approach to
constrain the boundary nodes.  In short, this means that for boundary nodes:
- Nodes on corner features cannot be moved.
- When nodes on edge features are moved, they must remain on that
edge feature.
- When boundary nodes on surface features are moved, they must not cross
edge features.

\image html ebsManifoldWithFeatures.jpg "The mesh after optimization using the manifold with features approach.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.10 the mean is 0.85."
\image latex ebsManifoldWithFeatures.pdf "The mesh after optimization using the manifold with features approach.  The minimum modified condition number is 0.10 the mean is 0.85."

\image html ebsManifoldWithFeaturesBack.jpg "The mesh after optimization using the manifold with features approach.  View from the back."
\image latex ebsManifoldWithFeaturesBack.pdf "The mesh after optimization using the manifold with features approach.  View from the back."

We see that the optimization has not improved the quality of the elements
as much as before, but the shape of the object has been accurately
maintained.

For this example, it is difficult to see how the mesh changed when using
the manifold with features approach.  One might ask whether the shape of
the model was preserved because the nodes were moved well or whether they
just were not moved.  The following figures show the edges for the initial
mesh in red and the edges for the optimized mesh in blue.  They show that
nodes on surface features were allowed to move along the surface and nodes
on edge features were allowed to move along edge features.
