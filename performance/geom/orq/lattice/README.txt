stlib/performance/geom/orq/lattice/README

The executables in this directory test the data structures for the
case that the records lie on lattice points in 3-D.  An ORQ is done for
each record in the file.  The search radius is 2.5 times the lattice
spacing.  Give the size of the lattice and the search radius as a command 
line arguments.
Example: Compute window queries for points in a 10x10x10 grid with a search
radius of 2.5.
	CellArray.exe 10 2.5
