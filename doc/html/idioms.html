<h2>Classes</h2>

<!-- -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -->
<h3>Prefer simple classes and don't add unnecessary functions.</h3>

<p>
Consider the following two implementations of a class. 
</p>

<pre>
class Foo {
private:
   int _bar;
public:
   int getBar() const {
      return _bar;
   }
   void setBar(const int bar) {
      _bar = bar;
   }
};
</pre>

<pre>
struct Foo {
   int bar;
};
</pre>

<p>
The latter is clearly superior. It is more succinct; the intention is
clearer. The former is a misapplication of the data hiding
principle. If you declare a data member to be private you are at least
indicating that the user should not be able to directly manipulate its
value. In addition, maybe the user should not be able to access it's
value. Thus, declaring a data member as private and then implementing
an accessor and a manipulator is just extra work and obfuscates the
functionality.
</p>

<h2>Constructors, Destructors and Assignment Operators</h2>

<!-- -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -->
<h3>Let the compiler define constructors and the destructor.</h3>

<p>
It is usually preferable to let the compiler define the copy
constructor, assignment operator, and destructor. These synthesized
functions will likely be more efficient than user-implemented
versions. However, if you allocate memory with <code>new</code>
(which you should not do unless you are writing a container class)
then you will need to implement these functions.
</p>

<p>
If your class has constant member data, the assignment operator will
not be synthesized. If you want to enable assignment, you will have
to define that operator. Below is an example.
</p>
<pre>
template&lt;typename _T&gt;
class Foo {
private:
   const _T _eps;
   _T _data;

public:
   Foo() :
      _eps(std::sqrt(std::numeric_limits&lt;_T&gt;::epsilon())),
      _data() {
   }

   Foo&
   operator=(const Foo& other) {
      if (this != &other) {
         // _eps already has the correct value.
         _data = other._data;
      }
      return *this;
   }
};
</pre>


<!-- -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -->
<h3>Explicitly initialize variables.</h3>

<p>
C++ has complicated initialization rules. Consider the following program.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int a;

void foo() {
   int b;
   std::cout &lt;&lt; "b = " &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

int main() {
   std::cout &lt;&lt; "a = " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; '\n';
   foo();
   return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
When I compile and run this program I get the following output.
</p>
<pre>
a = 0
b = 10
</pre>

<p>
Recall that static objects are initialized to 0 if no initializer is
specified. By contrast automatic objects with no specified initializer
are left uninitialized. Because <tt>a</tt> is a global variable, it is
a static object and thus is initialized to 0. Since <tt>b</tt> is a
local variable, it is an automatic object and in this case its initial
value could be any integer. Of course this behavior is obvious to
an expert like you. However, someone with less experience might be
not realize all of the implications of constructing an object without
an initial value. Thus it is best to follow a simple rule: <i>Never use
default rules to initialize a variable.</i> If you specify the
initial value then even novices may understand your code. In
considering the following two examples (which are equivalent because
of the default initialization rules) it is apparent that the latter
is better style.
</p>

<pre>
int a;
bool b;

struct Foo {
   int x;
};
Foo foo;

class Bar {
   int _x;
public:
   Bar() :
      _x() {
   }
};
</pre>

<pre>
int a = 0;
bool b = false;

struct Foo {
   int x;
};
Foo foo = {0};

class Bar {
   int _x;
public:
   Bar() :
      _x(0) {
   }
};
</pre>

<h3>Use initializer lists in constructors.</h3>

<p>
Use initializer lists instead of assignment to initialize member
variables in constructors. This will improve both the readability and the
performance of your code.
List all of your member variables (in the
order that you declared them) in the initializer list. If you don't
use the correct order the compiler will probably complain because 
the variables must be initialized in the order they were declared.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that you were to use assignment instead of an initializer list as
shown below.
<pre>
class Circle {
private
  std::tr1::&lt;double, 2&gt; _center;
  double _radius;
public:
  Circle(const std::tr1::&lt;double, 2&gt;&amp; center, const double radius) {
    _center = center;
    _radius = radius;
  }
  ...
};
</pre>
This will hurt performance because the variables will first be default
initialized and then assigned a value. In effect, the following
operations are performed.
<pre>
// Initialization.
_center[0] = 0;
_center[1] = 0;
_radius = 0;
// Assignment.
_center[0] = center[0];
_center[1] = center[1];
_radius = radius;
</pre>
It is better to use the following form.
<pre>
 Circle(const std::tr1::&lt;double, 2&gt;&amp; center, const double radius) :
    _center(center),
    _radius(radius) {
  }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Below is an example of the correct use of initializer lists. Note that
you can only default initialize arrays. That is, you cannot set the
array values in the initialization list. You must perform that
assignment in the body of the constructor. (Note that you should
prefer <tt>std::vector</tt> or <tt>std::tr1::array</tt> to
plain arrays.)
<pre>
class Foo {
private:
  double _parameter;
  double _coordinates[3];
  float _density;
  std::vector<double> _values;
  std::string _name;

public:
  Foo(const double parameter, const double x, const double y,
      const double z, const std::size_t numValues, const std::string& name) :
    _parameter(parameter),
    _coordinates(),
    _density(0),
    _sizes(numValues),
    _name(name) {
    _coordinates[0] = x;
    _coordinates[1] = y;
    _coordinates[2] = z;
  }
  ...
};
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Macros</h2>

<!-- -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -->
<h3>Don't use macros to define constants.</h3>

<p>
The C++ preprocessor is basically a text substitution program.  It doesn't
know about C++ syntax.  Don't use macros to define constants.  The C++ language
has several better ways of doing that.  Instead of using
<pre>
#define N 256
</pre>
prefer the following
<pre>
const std::size_t ArraySize = 256;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Using the preprocessor to define constants in a source file is ill-advised.
Doing so in a header file is downright evil.  The macro substitition rules
spill over into an source file that include the header.
</p>


<!-- -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -->
<h3>Don't use macros to define functions.</h3>

Sometimes people use macros to define functions to that the function works
for a variety of argument types.  Use templated functions instead.  Macros
don't know anything about C++ syntax.  It is better to use language features.
Instead of
<pre>
#define MIN(x,y) (x &lt y : x ? y)
</pre>
use
<pre>
template&lt;typename T&gt
inline
min(const T x, const T y) {
  return (x &lt y : x ? y);
}
</pre>




<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<h3>Static</h3>
<p>
In C, the keyword <strong>static</strong> can be used to indicate that a
function or object is local to a translation unit.  For example, one can
have:
<pre>
static int a;
static void f() {...}
</pre>
in multiple source files.  Each translation unit will have its own variable
<strong>a</strong> and function <strong>f()</strong>.  This usage of
<strong>static</strong> is deprecated in C++.
(See "The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup.)
Instead, use unnamed namespaces:
<pre>
namespace {
  int a;
  void f() {...}
}
</pre>
</p>


<h3>Using</h3>
<p>
Avoid using <strong>using</strong> declarations to strip namespaces.
Statements like
<pre>
using namespace std;
using namespace ads;
</pre>
are dangerous.  They dump the contents of a namespace into the local scope.
If you are lucky, this may lead to name collisions that are detected at
compile time.  However, it may also lead to the worst kind of error, a program
that compiles and runs but gives unexpected results.  Consider the
following program.
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt

double
distance(const double* x, const double* y) {
  return *y - *x;
}

int 
main() {
  double x = 1, y = 2.5;
  std::cout &lt&lt distance(&x, &y) &lt&lt "\n";
  return 0;
}
</pre>
It gives the result 1.5.  A novice user might put in a <strong>using</strong>
statement to avoid having to qualify <strong>cout</strong> with
<strong>std::</strong>.
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt

double
distance(const double* x, const double* y) {
  return *y - *x;
}

int 
main() {
  using namespace std;
  double x = 1, y = 2.5;
  cout &lt&lt distance(&x, &y) &lt&lt "\n";
  return 0;
}
</pre>
Now the program gives a different result, -1 when I ran it.  In the second
program, an STL function that computes distance between iterators is called.
<pre>
template&lt;class InputIterator&gt
typename iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt::difference_type
distance(InputIterator first, InputIterator last);
</pre>
Some developers consider their code to be more aesthetically pleasing when
they don't have to use namespace qualifications, and thus carelessly
strip off namespaces with <strong>using</strong> statements.  This is
bad programming and can lead to insidous errors.  While using
<strong>using</strong> in this manner in a source code file is a bad idea,
putting it in a header file is truly evil.  Then this dangerous practice
is propagated to every source file that includes that header.
</p>

<h3>Interfaces and Argument Dependent Lookup</h3>

<p>
If a class is defined in a namespace, put all associated free functions in
that namespace as well. Note that the C++ rules on
<a href="">argument dependent lookup</a> will enable you to use those
free functions without explicitly qualifying them. In the example below,
the output operator is declared in the <code>foo</code> namespace. When
it is used in <code>main</code>, there is no need to explicitly qualify
the namespace, i.e. <code>foo::operator&lt&lt(std::cout, bar)</code>.
</p>
<pre>
namespace foo {
  class Bar {...};

  std::ostream&
  operator&lt&lt(std::ostream&, const Bar& bar) {...}
}

int
main() {
  foo::Bar bar;
  std::cout &lt&lt bar;
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<h2>Including Files</h2>


<!-- -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -->
<h3>Relative Paths</h3>

<p>
Within a library, use relative paths to include files.  Do not rely on the
user adding an include path at compile time.  The user should be able to
include a header in the library and compile with a command as simple as:
<pre>
g++ test.cc
</pre>
</p>


<!-- -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -->
<h3>Dependency Errors</h3>


Dependency errors occur when a header <code>B.h</code> uses
functionality from another header <code>A.h</code> which it does not include.
Then using
<pre>
#include "A.h"
#include "B.h"
</pre>
in a <code>.cc</code> file works fine, but using
<pre>
#include "B.h"
#include "A.h"
</pre>
results in a compilation error.  You can avoid dependency errors by using unit
tests and not using convenience headers in your tests and examples.


<!-- -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -->
<h3>Convenience Headers</h3>


<p>
In a project with many packages, it is a good idea to have
<em>convenience headers</em> to make it easier for the user to access
an entire package.  For each source code directory, there is a corresponding
header file, which includes all of the files in that directory.  For example,
if one were using bounding boxes from the computational geometry package,
one could use:
<pre>
#include "stlib/src/geom/kernel/BBox.h"
</pre>
If one wanted to use several geometric primitives in the
<strong>kernel</strong> sub-package one could use 
<pre>
#include "stlib/src/geom/kernel.h"
</pre>
to include all of the header files in the <strong>kernel</strong>
directory.  One can also include all of the classes and functions in the
computational geometry package.
<pre>
#include "stlib/src/geom.h"
</pre>
</p>

<p>
It's a good idea to provide convenience headers because for the user they
are... well, convenient.  For someone who is not very familiar with a library,
they allow one to remain blissfully unaware of the file structure.  Using
convenience headers comes at the cost of increased compilation time and
decreased portability.  Obviously, including unnecessary files
increases the compilation time.  If one is using a compiler that is only
partially supported, then one would want to include as little code as possible.
The more header files you include, the more likely you are to encounter
a construct that your compiler doesn't like.
</p>

<p>
The developer should not use the convenience headers in the source code,
the test code, or example code.  The primary issues are correctness and
portability; compilation time is of secondary importance.  Using convenience
headers in the source code decreases the portability because it increases
the unnecessary headers that will be included in a user's application code.
Using convenience headers in the test code or example code may hide
dependency errors.  
</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>
Don't use exception specifications such as the following.
<pre>
void f() throw();
void g() throw(A, B);
void h() throw(...);
</pre>
Part of the idea behind exception specifications was that they would help
the compiler optimize code because it can make assumptions like: This function
will never throw an exception.  The reality is that these constructs may
hurt performance because the compiler generates extra code that checks
the exception specifications at <em>run time</em>.
</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<!-- -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - -->
<h3>Virtual Bases</h3>

<p>
When using ordinary (non-virtual) inheritance, a class may only initialize
its direct bases.  Below is an example.
<pre>
class A {
public:
  A(int n);
}

class B: public A {
public:
  B(const int n) : A(n) {}
}

class C: public A {
public:
  C(const int n) : A(n) {}
}

class D: public B, public C {
public:
  D(const int n) : B(n), C(n) {}
}
</pre>
The code below is erroneous.  <code>A</code> is not a direct base of
<code>D</code>.
<pre>
class D: public B, public C {
public:
  // Error: A is not a direct base, so cannot call its constructor.
  D(const int n) : A(n), B(n), C(n) {}
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
By contrast, when you use virtual bases,
it is the responsibility of the most derived
class to initialize them.  (Check out the Poisson random deviate classes in
the <code>src/numerical/random</code> directory.  They each have
<code>UsesUniformRandomDeviate</code> as a virtual base.)  The code below
illustrates this point.  <code>A</code> is a virtual base for <code>B</code>
and <code>C</code>.  Hence it is a virtual base for <code>D</code>.
<code>D</code> must explicitly call <code>A</code>'s constructor to get
the correct behavior, it will not
be called through either <code>B</code> or <code>C</code>.
<pre>
class A {
public:
  A(int n);
}

class B: public virtual A {
public:
  B(const int n) : A(n) {}
}

class C: public virtual A {
public:
  C(const int n) : A(n) {}
}

class D: public B, public C {
public:
  D(const int n) : A(n), B(n), C(n) {}
}
</pre>
If <code>D</code> did not explicitly call <code>A</code>'s constructor,
then its default constructor (not the integer constructor) would implicitly
be called.  This behavior can cause logic errors that are difficult to detect.
If the virtual base does not need a default constructor, make it private.
This will force derived classes to explicitly initialize the virtual base.
<pre>
class A {
private:
  // This forces derived classes to use the integer constructor.
  A();
public:
  A(int n);
}
</pre>
Then the following code will result in a compilation error.
<pre>
class D: public B, public C {
public:
  D(const int n) : B(n), C(n) {}
}
</pre>
</p>


<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<h2>Const</h2>

<p>
If a variable or member function is constant, declare it as such.
<pre>
const int Dimension = 3;

class A {
private:
  int _value;
public:
  int getValue() const {
    return _value;
  }
}
</pre>
Concerning function arguments: when defining a function, use
<code>const</code> for arguments that are not modified.
<pre>
int
f(const int n) {
  ...
}
</pre>
However, do not use <code>const</code> when <em>declaring</em> a function.
<pre>
int
f(int n);
</pre>
This is because <code>int f(int n)</code> and <code>int f(const int n)</code>
have the same signature.  The <const>const</const> is an implementation
detail of the function.  It has no effect on the caller.
</p>

<p>
There are some subtleties in using <code>const</code> with
pointers. There are four possibilities shown in the table below.
<table>
  <tr align=left>
    <td><code>int* x = ... </code>
    <td>Pointer to <code>int</code>.
  <tr align=left>
    <td><code>const int* x = ... </code>
    <td>Pointer to <code>const int</code>. Modifying the pointee
      (<code>x[0] = 5;</code> for example) is not allowed.
  <tr align=left>
    <td><code>int* const x = ... </code>
    <td>Const pointer to <code>int</code>. Modifying the pointee
      is allowed, but modifying the pointer
      (<code>x = 0;</code> for example) is not.
  <tr align=left>
    <td><code>const int* const x = ... </code>
    <td>Const pointer to <code>const int</code>. Modifying the
      pointer or pointee is not allowed.
</table>
</p>

<p>
Use a pointer to constant type when the pointee should not be
modified.
<pre>
std::vector<double> x(10);
...
const double* first = &x[0];
</pre>
You will usually want to use a constant pointer when you
dynamically allocate memory. This is because you don't want to lose
the handle to the memory that you will later need to free. Below
is an example.
<pre>
double* const x = new double[10];
for (std::size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i) {
   x[i] = i;
}
...
delete[] x;
</pre>
Use a const pointer to a const type for dynamically allocated
constants or for constant arrays.
<pre>
const char* const message = "Hello, World!";
</pre>
</p>
