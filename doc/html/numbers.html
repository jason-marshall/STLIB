<h2>Integer Types</h2>

<p>
Many hackers use <code>int</code> whenever an integer type is needed.
They have various reasons for doing so:
<ul>
  <li> The Goldilocks principle: <code>short</code> is too small, and
  <code>long</code> is too big, but <code>int</code> is just right.
  <li> <code>int</code> is easy to type and using it makes code look
  &quot;clean.&quot;
  <li> <code>int</code> is The One true integer type. You can use even
  use it for Boolean values; zero is false and nonzero is true.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In spite of these excellent reasons, using <code>int</code> is actually a bad
idea. It can obfuscate the purpose of your code and introduce wicked bugs.
Let's consider a typical code snippet:
</p>
<pre>
std::vector&lt;double&gt; x;
...
for (int i = 0; i != x.size(); ++i) {
...
</pre>

<p>
Compiling such code with warning enabled will give you an annoying message
like &quot;<tt>warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer
expressions</tt>.&quot; The problem is that the <code>size()</code> member
function returns a <code>std::size_t</code>, which is either a 32-bit
or a 64-bit unsigned integer, depending on whether you are making a 32-bit
or a 64-bit executable. The compiler issues a warning because comparing
signed and unsigned integers is a bad idea. To rid oneself of this
annoyance, the typical solution is to either disable warnings or to
truncate the size type, i.e.
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i != int(x.size()); ++i) {
</pre>
However, the correct solution is to use the size type for the iteration
variable.
<pre>
for (std::size_t i = 0; i != x.size(); ++i) {
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Why are the first two loops incorrect? Because they give erroneous results
whenever the number of elements in the vector exceeds 2<sup>31</sup>.
In the first example we compare a signed integer to a size type. If the vector
is too large then this loop will never terminate. When the integer index
reaches
2,147,483,647, incrementing it results in an overflow and it takes the value
-2,147,483,648. Of course you would notice if your program entered
an infinite loop. The second version has an error that may be more difficult
to detect. The problem is in casting the size type to an <code>int</code>.
If the size type has 32 bits then sizes greater that 2<sup>31</sup>
will be converted to a negative integer. For 64-bit applications
the truncation may result in an incorrect value that is either positive or
negative. Depending on the circumstances you may encounter an infinite loop,
a segmentation fault, or your program may complete and just give incorrect
results.
</p>

<p>
Of course you are probably thinking &quot;Yeah, but I would never create
a vector with 2 billion elements.&quot; That may be true, but the fact that
using <code>int</code> usually works is part of what makes the resulting
errors so insidious. If they do appear, you will have no idea what is
causing your code to crash or give incorrect results.
</p>

<p>
I think that most people use <code>int</code> because they don't know what type
they <it>should</it> be using. Maybe they think that using the
&quot;right&quot; approach would complicate their lives. If you are such
an unfortunate soul, then rejoice and prepare to be enlightened! The
rules for properly using integer types are really simple. Following them
will improve the robustness and readability of your code.
<ul>
  <li> Use <code>std::size_t</code> for loops, array indexing, and quantities
  that are sizes or counts.
  <li> Use <code>bool</code> for Boolean values.
  <li> Use <code>std::ptrdiff_t</code> for distances between pointers.
  <li> For any other scenarios, think for a moment about what is 
  appropriate.
</ul>
See, that wasn't so bad. The first two cases are applicable 99% of the
time. Thinking is rarely necessary. Below are some examples.
</p>

<pre>
const std::size_t Dimension = 3;
typedef std::tr1::array&lt;double, Dimension&gt; Point;
std::vector&lt;Point&gt; centers;
...
// Initialize each coordinate to zero.
const Point origin = {{}};
bool hasPointAtOrigin = std::find(centers.begin(), centers.end(), origin) != centers.end();
...
// The return type of count() is an iterator difference type (for a good reason).
// Here it is sensible to assign that to a size type.
const std::size_t numberAtOrigin = std::count(centers.begin(), centers.end(), origin);
for (std::size_t i = 0; i != centers.size(); ++i) {
    centers[i] = ...
}
...
class Matrix {
...
    Matrix(const std::size_t numRows, const std::size_t numCols);
...
    std::size_t size() const;
    bool empty() const;
};
</pre>

<!--CONTINUE Cite pessimism in C++ Coding Standards.-->

<p>
Now it's time for a quiz. What is troubling about the following code?
</p>
<pre>
class Foo {
    ...
    int id() const {
        return int(this);
    }
    ...
};
</pre>
<p>
If you said that you may lose precision in casting a pointer to an integer,
then good for you! That was a lucky guess. In a 64-bit executable, casting
a pointer to an integer truncates a 64-bit pointer to a 32-bit
<code>int</code>. That means the identifiers may not be unique.
Depending on your compiler, the
above may or may not compile. Switching to <code>std::size_t</code>
will get rid of the truncation problem and the compiler error.
</p>
<pre>
    std::size_t id() const {
        return std::size_t(this);
    }
</pre>

<p>
If at this point you are dissatisfied then you get a gold star! The
deeply disturbing thing about the above example is that 
the address of the object is being used as its identifier. Switching
from <code>int</code> to <code>std::size_t</code> makes the code
syntactically correct, but it is not semantically correct. That is,
the identifier produced above does not behave like an identifier
should. I have no idea what a Foo is, but I would expect that if I
copied one the identifier in the original and the copy would be the
same. Consider the following uses of Foo.
</p>
<pre>
Foo a;
...
Foo b = a; // Uh-oh. b.id() != a.id()
...
std::swap(a, b); // Uh-oh. The identifiers are not swapped.
...
std::vector&lt;Foo&gt; output;
for (std::size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i) {
     Foo x;
     output.push_back(x); // Uh-oh. The identifiers get changed whenever the vector is resized.
}
std::map<std::size_t, Foo> dict;
dict[a.id()] = a; // Uh-oh. Inserting the object changes its identifier.
</pre>

<h2>Floating-Point Types</h2>

<p>
If you want to understand floating-point arithmetic read
<a href="What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic"></a>
by David Goldberg. If you don't have the time to read that article or
just prefer ignorance then read the rest of this section
(or at least skim it). If you don't have the time to do that
then just use <tt>double</tt>. And get back to work!
</p>

<p>
Use <tt>float</tt> in the following circumstances:
<ul>
  <li>
  Storage optimization. You have large arrays of numbers and you only
  need single precision accuracy. Using <tt>float</tt> instead of double
  will allow you to double the problem size.
  <li>
  Performance optimization. You are running on the GPU (or other specialized
  hardware) or are using SSE intrinsics in which case single precision
  arithmetic is much faster than double precision arithmetic.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Otherwise use <tt>double</tt>. On modern super scalar processors there is
no performance difference between using single and double precision.
The floating point unit performs calculations using 80-bit registers and
truncates the result when storing values in single precision (32-bit)
and double precision (64-bit) variables. In this respect the extra
precision in <tt>double</tt> comes for free. There is usually little
performance difference between algorithms that use single or double
precision numbers. In some cases using <tt>float</tt> will boost
performance because the decreased storage requirements lead to
better cache utilization, but this is not typical. When doing numerical
calculations you probably assume that the number type you are
using has ample precision. Verifying that truncation errors are acceptable
takes a lot of work. If you use double precision numbers your
assumption of having plenty of precision is more likely to be correct.
