<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
Document your code! Write the documentation before, during, and immediately
after you write the source code: Write some documentation for each function
and class before you write the code.  This will help you understand its
purpose and clarify its functionality.  Finish the documentation while the
code is still fresh in your mind.  Otherwise you will have to study the code
again when (if) you come back to write the documentation.
</p>

<p>
Place the documentation (including performance results, links to graphics,
etc.) with the source code.  The quality of the documentation is inversely
proportional to its distance from the source code.  I recommend using
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>
to build reference manuals in HTML or PDF format.
</p>

<p>
If you have multiple packages in a project it may be best to have separate
Doxygen configuration files for each package and generate the documentation
for each package separately. This provides a logical grouping of the
items. You can get cross-links between the packages by using tag files.
The list of tag files should include the packages that are used by the
target. Typically do not include packages that use the target in the list;
doing so may inject distracting template specializations into the inheritance
graphs and collaboration graphs.
</p>

<h2>Unit Tests</h2>

<p>
Use unit tests to improve the reliability of your code.  For each source
file, have a unit test file.  Test each non-trivial piece of functionality.
Be sure to consider special cases like negative values or null pointers.
It is important to be able to easily use your unit tests.  You should be able
to compile and/or run all of your unit tests with a single command.  This
makes it easy to tell if an improvement in one package breaks functionality
in another.
