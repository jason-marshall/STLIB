There are ten top-level directories:
<table>
  <tr align=left><th>data<td> Data files.
  <tr align=left><th>doc<td> Documentation.
  <tr align=left><th>doxygen<td> Configuration files and makefiles for
    building the documentation.
  <tr align=left><th>examples<td> Drivers and example programs.
  <tr align=left><th>src<td> The source code. (All header files.)
  <tr align=left><th>performance<td> Drivers to test the performance of the
    algorithms.
  <tr align=left><th>prototypes<td> Prototypes for testing new algorithms.
  <tr align=left><th>results<td> Makefiles that use the example programs to
    produce results.
  <tr align=left><th>test<td> Uniting testing code.
  <tr align=left><th>utilities<td> Utility programs.
</table>
</p>

<p>
In some distributions of this code the documentation is pre-built. If you have 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>, 
you can build it yourself by executing <strong>make</strong> in the 
<strong>doxygen</strong> directory. As a user, you will work with the source
code in <strong>src</strong> and the drivers in
<strong>examples</strong>.
The <strong>data</strong> directory will also be useful for running
the drivers. There is probably no need to look in the other directories.

This library is composed entirely of header files.
To use any class or function in this library, simply include the file that
contains its definition. The packages are composed of header files with a
<code>.h</code> suffix and implementation files with a <code>.ipp</code>
suffix. The header
files contain the user interface: class definitions and function declarations.
Although the documentation presents all of the classes and functions, you
may prefer to directly browse the header files.
The <code>.ipp</code> files contain the function definitions. It should not
be necessary to study these files as they are an implementation detail.

<p>
Eeach top-level package in STLib has its own namespace. These are enumerated
in the <a href="#Packages">Packages section</a>. There is no namespace
for STLib as a whole.
