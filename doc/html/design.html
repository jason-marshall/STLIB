<p>
Software design is an important step that affects the usability and
performance of your code.  Unfortunately, this step is often skipped in
the mad rush to get results.
Here are some important question to ask when considering a design.
<ul>
  <li>Is the design simple and intuitive?</li>
  
  <li>What does the design enable?
  <ul>
    <li>Compile time flexibility?</li>
    <li>Run time flexibility?</li>
    <li>Multi-threaded applications?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Can the code easily be modified or extended?
  <ul>
    <li>Can it be extended without altering your code?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Concerning software designs: plan to throw one away.  As you develop a project
you will likely find that your initial design is flawed or lacking in
some respects.  This is natural, you should expect to modify (or completely
redo) the initial design.  If you use a top-down development process, the
task of modifying the software design will be simplified.  Hopefully you
will be able to see the shortcomings of you initial design while you are
still in the early stages of the project.
