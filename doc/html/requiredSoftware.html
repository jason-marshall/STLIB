<h1 align=center>Required Software</h1>

<a href="index.html">Back</a>

<p>
In order to use STLib, you will need some third-party software.
<a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> is required for most packages. 
Note that you don't need the compiled Boost libraries, just the headers.
<a href="https://github.com/philsquared/Catch">Catch</a> is required
for some unit tests. This is a pure header library, so
no compilation is required.
Both the <code>geom/shape</code> package and the implicit
tau-leaping in <code>stochastic</code> use 
<a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/">Eigen</a>.
</p>

<p>
In order to compile sources that use STLib, these libraries must be in
your include path. Here we give instructions for putting them in 
<code>include</code> in your home directory.
</p>

<p>
For Catch, get the latest
<a href="http://builds.catch-lib.net">single header version</a>.
Right click on <code>Latest Master build</code> and save the linked
file to your <code>Downloads</code> folder. Then move the file to
<code>include</code>.
<pre>
$ cd ~/include
$ cp ~/Downloads/catch.hpp .
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Download the latest version of Boost and unpack it. Then copy the
header files to <code>include</code>.
<pre>
$ cp -R ~/Downloads/boost_1_56_0/boost .
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Download the latest version of Eigen and unpack it. Then copy the
header files to <code>include</code>.
<pre>
$ cp -R ~/Downloads/eigen-eigen-1306d75b4a21/Eigen .
</pre>
</p>


<h1 align=center>MS Windows</h1>

<p>
If you develop on MS Windows, then using STLib should be fairly easy. Just 
put it in a convenient location and put <code>path/to/stlib</code> in your
include path when you compile. You will likely also need the
Boost++ headers. The rest of this section is documentation for myself.
I describe how to set up a development environment on Windows.
</p>

<p>
Install the Visual Studio Express Windows Desktop application. (This requires
less disk space than the other applications.)
Install the following:
Windows PowerShell 4.0, Microsoft MPI, Python 2.7, SCons, Git, and SourceTree.
Add <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\MPI\Lib\x86</code> (or the
<code>x64</code> directory for 64-bit architectures) and 
<code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code> to the system <code>Path</code> 
environment variable.
</p>


<p>
Install Boost++. I recommend grabbing one of the installers with pre-compiled
binaries instead of installing from source. Suppose that it is installed in
<code>C:\local\boost_1_58_0</code>. Add the library directory to the system
<code>Path</code> environment variable. For example, you might add the
<code>C:\local\boost_1_58_0\lib32-msvc-12.0</code> directory. In your home
directory, create an <code>include</code> directory. There, add a junction
to the Boost++ include directory. To do this, click the <code>Start</code>
button and then right-click on <code>Command Prompt</code> and select
<code>Run as administrator</code>. Navigate to the <code>include</code>
directory and execute the following command.
<pre>
C:\Users\Sean\include>mklink /D boost C:\local\boost_1_58_0\boost
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Download the single header file for Catch and put <code>catch.hpp</code>
in the <code>include</code> directory.
Download Eigen. Copy the <code>Eigen</code> directory, which contains the
header files, to the 
<code>include</code> directory in your home directory.
</p>

<p>
After cloning stlib with SourceTree, add a junction to stlib in your 
<code>include</code> directory.
<pre>
C:\Users\Sean\include>mklink /D stlib C:\Users\Sean\dev\stlib\stlib
</pre>
</p>

<!-- I can't get the debugger to work.
<p>
To get debugging software, install the Windows Software Development Kit
for Windows 8.1. During the installation, deselect all components except 
the debugging one.
</p>
-->

<p>
Incidentally, don't try using SharpKeys to swap the control, alt, and Windows 
keys. The program can override keys, but it can't swap them.
