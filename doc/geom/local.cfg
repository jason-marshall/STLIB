# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put.

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank the following patterns are tested: 
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx *.hpp

# The TAGFILES option can be used to specify one or more tagfiles. 
# Optionally an initial location of the external documentation 
# can be added for each tagfile. The format of a tag file without 
# this location is as follows: 
#   TAGFILES = file1 file2 ... 
# Adding location for the tag files is done as follows: 
#   TAGFILES = file1=loc1 "file2 = loc2" ... 
# where "loc1" and "loc2" can be relative or absolute paths or 
# URLs. If a location is present for each tag, the installdox tool 
# does not have to be run to correct the links.
# Note that each tag file must have a unique name
# (where the name does NOT include the path)
# If a tag file is not located in the directory in which doxygen 
# is run, you must also specify the path to the tagfile here.
