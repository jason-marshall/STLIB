# This is a local configuration file.  It is appended to the main
# configuration file to make the file the Doxygen will process.
# The environment variable SOURCE_DIR should be defined in the makefile.
#


# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "SIMD Programming"

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be 
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.

HTML_OUTPUT            = html/simd

# The LATEX_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the LaTeX docs will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be 
# put in front of it. If left blank `latex' will be used as the default path.

LATEX_OUTPUT           = latex/simd

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain 
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or 
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories 
# with spaces.

INPUT                  = \
../stlib/simd 

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank the following patterns are tested: 
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx *.hpp 
# *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.h *.cc

# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or 
# directories that contain image that are included in the documentation (see 
# the \image command).

IMAGE_PATH             = simd/graphics

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or 
# directories that contain example code fragments that are included (see 
# the \include command).

EXAMPLE_PATH           = simd/tables

# The DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index at 
# top of each HTML page. The value NO (the default) enables the index and 
# the value YES disables it.

DISABLE_INDEX          = NO

# The TAGFILES option can be used to specify one or more tagfiles. 
# Optionally an initial location of the external documentation 
# can be added for each tagfile. The format of a tag file without 
# this location is as follows: 
#   TAGFILES = file1 file2 ... 
# Adding location for the tag files is done as follows: 
#   TAGFILES = file1=loc1 "file2 = loc2" ... 
# where "loc1" and "loc2" can be relative or absolute paths or 
# URLs. If a location is present for each tag, the installdox tool 
# does not have to be run to correct the links.
# Note that each tag file must have a unique name
# (where the name does NOT include the path)
# If a tag file is not located in the directory in which doxygen 
# is run, you must also specify the path to the tagfile here.

TAGFILES               = \

# When a file name is specified after GENERATE_TAGFILE, doxygen will create 
# a tag file that is based on the input files it reads.
